    The Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal Management API offers programmatic
    access to all portal resources that your instance of the portal manages.
    This API repeats functionality of the user interface and enables APIs
    consumers integrating their portal instances with their other IT systems
    such as billings, CRMs, ITSM systems and other software.


    ## Authentication

        This endpoint uploads a theme that is archived as a zip file to the
        portal.


        If a theme with this name already exists in the portal, the uploaded
        theme will replace the existing one. Otherwise, a new theme will be
        created.


        The name of a theme is stored in the `name` field of `theme.json`.
