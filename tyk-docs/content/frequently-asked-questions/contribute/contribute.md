## How to contribute to our docs

We encourage anyone to contribute to our documentation. You can open an [issue](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-docs/issues) about our documentation, or suggest a change by submitting a pull request to the [Tyk Docs GitHub repo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-docs).

Our docs are compiled using the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/).
