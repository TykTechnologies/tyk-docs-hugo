With Datadog you can view logs of all your Tyk components.
To allow Datadog Agent to scrape the logs of your Tyk deployment correctly you need to create a pipeline in Datadog, to process and underst and this data.

To do that, we need to access the `/logs/pipelines` path on your datadog web application.
This will take us to the pipeline configuration page.
In here, we will create a new pipeline.
For the filter section, use `Service:tyk-*` this will capture logs for any of the Tyk related services.

Next, we will need to add a processor to the pipeline.

Select the Grok Parser processor type, give it a name and click on the `Parse My Logs` button and `Create` .

Lastly, add another processor to the pipeline. Select the Status Remapper processor type, give it a name and set the status attribute to `level` then `Create`.

The Tyk logs statuses should now be shown under the right status.
