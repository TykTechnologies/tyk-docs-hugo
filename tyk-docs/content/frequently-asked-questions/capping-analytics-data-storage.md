What methods are available to enable me to manage my MongoDB analytics storage?

[Time Based Caps](/docs/analytics-and-reporting/capping-analytics-data-storage/#a-name-time-based-cap-a-time-based-cap)

[Size Based Caps](/docs/analytics-and-reporting/capping-analytics-data-storage/#a-name-size-based-cap-a-size-based-cap)

> **NOTE**: Time based caps (TTL indexes) are incompatible with already configured size based caps.
