### Description

When you attempt to access the Developer Portal (`https://xxxxxx:3000/portal`), you receive a `Not Found` error message

### Cause

The portal may not have been configured or may have been set up with the wrong domain name.

### Solution

You should make sure that your portal has been configured to use the correct domain name in `tyk_analytics.conf`. Once this change has been made you may need to restart the process so as to avoid having to reconfigure the Gateway as well.

You should also look at the [portal tutorials](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-developer-portal/tutorials/) for creating an API and publishing to your Portal.
