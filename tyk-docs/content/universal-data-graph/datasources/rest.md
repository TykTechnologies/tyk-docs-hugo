The REST DataSource is a base component of UDG to help you add existing REST APIs to your data graph.
By attaching a REST datasource to a field the engine will use the REST resource for resolving.

We have a video which demos this functionality for you.

To configure a REST datasource select the "DATA SOURCES" tab in the Schema editor.
Select a field, e.g. the "httpBinGet" field in this example on the "Query" type.
Finally on the right hand side select "DATA SOURCE" to configure the DataSource for this field.

For REST DataSources you're able to configure the URL, Method and the Headers.
Based on the input, a REST resolver will be generated to resolve the field at runtime.
