The error overview page limits the analytics down to errors only, and gives you a detailed look over the range of the number of errors that your APIs have generated. This view is very similar to the Dashboard, but will provide more detail on the error types:

{{< note success >}}
**Note**

From Tyk v5.1 (and LTS patches v4.0.14 and v5.0.3) the Errors by Category data will not be visible to a user if they are assigned the [Owned Analytics]({{< ref "basic-config-and-security/security/dashboard/user-roles#user-owned-analytics" >}}) permission.
