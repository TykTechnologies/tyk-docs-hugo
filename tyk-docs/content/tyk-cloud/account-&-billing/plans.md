## Changing Plans

You can upgrade or downgrade your current plan at any point in your billing cycle and your payment will be pro-rata'd to reflect the new payment.

### Downgrading Plan requirements

If you downgrade your plan, the new plan may have less entitlements than your current plan. You will need to restructure your organisation to comply with the new plan entitlements before the downgraded billing starts.
