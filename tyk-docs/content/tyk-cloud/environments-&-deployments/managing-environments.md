## Introduction

Environments are used to group your [Control Planes](/docs/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-support/glossary/#control-plane) and [Edge Gateways](/docs/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-support/glossary/#edge) into logical groups. For example you may want to create environments that reflect different departments of your organisation.

The number of Environments you can create is determined by your [plan](/docs/tyk-cloud/account-billing/plans/)
