## Introduction

Tyk Hybrid allows you to run a flexible and scalable SaaS solution. With Tyk Hybrid, the Management layer is hosted and managed by Tyk in AWS with the Gateway(s) deployed locally and managed by you with your own Data Centre, Public or Private Cloud or even on your own machine.

Tyk's Hybrid option provides you with a Tyk-hosted Cloud deployment, with the ability to deploy local Gateway across multiple locations. The Tyk hosted portion will include the Dashboard and Developer Portal. It would also allow you to run Tyk Pump locally, to maintain analytics and metrics within your chosen DB.

The connection between Hybrid Gateways and Tyk Cloud is always initiated from the Hybrid Gateway, not Tyk Cloud. As an example, you, as a customer, don't need to start punching holes in firewalls for inbound connections from Tyk Cloud.

Hybrid Gateways are available on our [14 Day Free Trial](/docs/tyk-cloud/account-billing/plans/#14-day-trial) and [Enterprise Global](/docs/tyk-cloud/account-billing/plans/#enterprise-global-plan) plans. 



Below is a sample Tyk Hybrid Gateway configuration file.

**Note**

For Tyk Cloud trial accounts, the MDCB endpoint serves a self signed certificate by default and we replace it with a public certificate during account onboarding.

## Hybrid Gateways in a Kubernetes Cluster
This Helm Chart provides a method of adding Hybrid Gateways into your Kubernetes cluster.
The Hybrid Gateways can be connected to *Tyk Cloud* or to a *Tyk Self managed Control plane* (a.k.a *MDCB*/*Tyk Multi Data Centre Bridge (MDCB)*).

### Prerequisites
- Redis: It is required for all Tyk installations and must be installed in the cluster or reachable from inside K8s. 

- Tyk Cloud Account: You need to set up a Tyk Cloud account 
[Getting Started with Tyk Cloud]({{< ref "/content/tyk-cloud/getting-started-tyk-cloud/getting-started-tyk-cloud.md" >}}) (With CP deployment set-up)

- Docker Repo: [https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker)

### Installation

This is Tyk's official Helm Charts repository `https://helm.tyk.io/public/helm/charts/`.
*Tyk Hybrid* Helm Chart is under the name `tyk-helm/tyk-hybrid`
You can also find it in [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/tyk-helm/tyk-hybrid).
<div class="artifacthub-widget" data-url="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/tyk-helm/tyk-hybrid" data-theme="light" data-header="true" data-responsive="true"><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><b>tyk-hybrid</b>: This chart deploys the open source Tyk Gateway with a Hybrid setup that connects to a management control plan. Tyk is a fully open source Enterprise API Gateway, supporting REST, GraphQL, TCP and gRPC protocols. Tyk Gateway is provided ‘Batteries-included’, with no feature lockout. It enables organisations and businesses around the world to protect, secure, and process APIs and well as review and audit the consumed apis.</p>&mdash; Open in <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/tyk-helm/tyk-hybrid">Artifact Hub</a></blockquote></div><script async src="https://artifacthub.io/artifacthub-widget.js"></script>

If you are interested in contributing to our charts, suggesting changes, creating PRs or any other way,
please use [GitHub Tyk-helm-chart repo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-helm-chart/tree/master/tyk-hybrid)

#### Add Tyk official Helm repo
1. clone all the repo files:

```bash
helm repo add tyk-helm https://helm.tyk.io/public/helm/charts/
helm repo update
```

Follow the docs in the repo, there's a <tyk.hybrid.conf> [https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker#hybrid](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker#hybrid) file that needs to be configured with the appropriate configuration items.

2. You need to change the following three values in <tyk.hybrid.conf>
 
```bash
"slave_options": {
"rpc_key": "<ORG_ID>",
"api_key": "<API-KEY>",
"connection_string": "<MDCB-INGRESS>:443", 
```

To change these, head to your Tyk Cloud account.

3. For the **MDCB-INGRESS**, choose the correct deployment and copy the MDCB URL.

4. We need an **ORG ID** and **API key** from the Tyk Cloud account.

5. Launch the API Manager Dashboard.
Within the API Manager Dashboard:
- Select your Hybrid user.
- Under that user, copy the API key and add it. 
- Copy and paste the Org ID and save it.

6. Finally, edit the <docker-compose.yml> file to swap over the **standalone config file** to use the **hybrid config file** that was just configured.
 
From: 

```bash
- ./tyk.standalone.conf:/opt/tyk-gateway/tyk.conf
```
To:

```bash
- ./tyk.hybrid.conf:/opt/tyk-gateway/tyk.conf
``` 

In this compose file, we've now got our gateway image, we've got Redis and we have some volume mappings.
 
```bash

-  Run <docker compose up -d>
```

You should now have two running containers, a Gateway and a Redis.

Now it is time to publish a new API [Task 5 - Deploy your Edge Gateway and add your first API]({{< ref "/content/tyk-cloud/getting-started-tyk-cloud/first-api.md" >}})

#### Create namespace for tyk deployment
```bash
kubectl create namespace tyk
```

#### Installing Redis
If you have an external SaaS Redis you can skip this section.

For Redis you can use these rather excellent chart provided by Bitnami:

```bash
helm install tyk-redis bitnami/redis -n tyk
```
Follow the notes from the installation output to get connection details and password.
```
  Redis(TM) can be accessed on the following DNS names from within your cluster:

    tyk-redis-master.tyk.svc.cluster.local for read/write operations (port 6379)
    tyk-redis-replicas.tyk.svc.cluster.local for read-only operations (port 6379)

  export REDIS_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace tyk tyk-redis -o jsonpath="{.data.redis-password}" | base64 --decode)
```

The DNS name of your Redis as set by Bitnami is `tyk-redis-master.tyk.svc.cluster.local:6379`
You can update them in your local `values.yaml` file under `redis.addrs` and `redis.pass`
Alternatively, you can use `--set` flag to set it in Tyk installation. For example  `--set redis.pass=$REDIS_PASSWORD`


{{< note success >}}
**Note**

If you a simple password-less version of redis, please check (these instructions)[/tyk-oss/ce-helm-chart/#installing-redis]
{{< /note >}}

#### Getting values.yaml
Before we proceed with installation of the chart you need to set some custom values.
To see what options are configurable on a chart and save that options to a custom `values.yaml` file run:
 ```bash
helm show values tyk-helm/tyk-hybrid > values.yaml
```

#### Setting values.yaml
1. To allow the *Tyk Hybrid Gateway* to connect to *Tyk control plane* (*MDCB* management layer), add your connection
string in the `gateway.rpc.connString`. On the Tyk Cloud Console find this value in the endpoints panel for your control plane deployment.
2. For *Tyk Gateway* to identify itself against *Tyk control plane*, add your Dashboard users API key in the `gateway.rpc.apiKey` field.
3. Add your Dashboard users organisation ID in the `gateway.rpc.rpcKey` field.

Check this (doc)[/tyk-multi-data-centre/setup-slave-data-centres/] for detailed explanation of the hybrid/worker Gateway settings.

#### Installing Tyk Open Source Gateway as a hybrid gateway
Now run the following command from the root of the repository:
```bash
helm install tyk-hybrid tyk-helm/tyk-hybrid -f values.yaml -n tyk
```
