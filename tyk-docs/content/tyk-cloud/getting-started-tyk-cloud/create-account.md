## Introduction

You can use Tyk Cloud to manage your APIs effectively and with minimal effort. This page explains how to create an account, in order to start doing so.

When you create your Tyk Cloud account, we do the following for you:

* Assign the account creator as a [Billing Admin](/docs/tyk-cloud/teams-users/user-roles/#user-roles-within-tyk-cloud) for the Organisation. This user role allows you to manage the billing and plans for your org. You can also add other billing admins as required.
* Assign the new account to our [free 14 day Tyk Cloud trial plan](/docs/tyk-cloud/account-billing/plans/#14-day-trial)

Watch our video on setting up your Tyk Cloud account.
