## Introduction

Now that you have completed onboarding you will setup a very basic API to demonstrate how APIs are managed within Tyk Cloud.

## Step One - Access the Dashboard

Go to the Control Plane overview and click the dashboard link in the Ingress list. You'll be redirected to the Tyk Dashboard for your [Control Plane](/docs/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-support/glossary/#control-plane).

## Step Two - Add a New API

Watch our video on Adding an API to your Tyk Cloud Dashboard.

Click the APIs menu item and then click **Add New API**.

## Step Three - Core Settings

1. Give Your API a name - We'll use "my app" for the rest of this Getting Started journey.
2. Scroll down to the **Target URL** setting and use the URL https://httpbin.org/
3. Then scroll down to the Authentication section and select **Open(Keyless)** to keep things simple for this demo.

**Warning**
  
Ensure you configure a valid API Listen path.  Root ("/") listen paths are **not** supported on Tyk Cloud deployments prior to version v3.2.0.

## Step Four - Advanced Options

1. Click the **Advanced Options** tab of the API Designer.
2. Scroll to the **Segment Tags (Node Segmentation)** setting and add the edge tag (edge) you saw when creating the Edge Gateway.

### How Segment Tags work in Tyk Cloud

When an Edge Gateway is deployed, the tag 'edge' and a location tag are automatically generated for the Edge Gateway. You use these tags to connect your API to the appropriate Edge Gateway. It works as follows:

* Add the **edge** tag to your API to connect it to all Edge Gateways within the Control Plane.
* Add the location tag to your API to connect it to only Edge Gateways with that location within the Control Plane.

{{< warning success >}}
**Warning**
  
All APIs must be connected to an Edge Gateway by adding the appropriate tag in the *Segment Tags (Node Segmentation)* in the API Designer.

## Step Five - Save Your API

Click **Save** from the API Designer. Your API will now be added to the APIs list.

Next you'll access your API from the Gateway Ingress.
