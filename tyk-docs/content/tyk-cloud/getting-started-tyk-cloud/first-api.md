## Introduction

Now that you have completed onboarding you will deploy your Edge Gateway and setup a very basic API to demonstrate how APIs are managed within Tyk Cloud.

## Step One - Deploy your Edge Gateway
1. From your Control Plane overview you will see the Edge Gateway is in a Not Deployed state. Click on your Edge Gateway to open its overview.
2. In the top right of your Edge Gateway overview, click **Not Deployed** and choose **Deploy** from the drop-down.
3. With your Edge Gateway successfully deployed, make a note of the tags assigned to your Edge Gateway. One tag is "edge" and the other is the location of your Edge Gateway. You'll add a tag when creating your API.

**Note**
  
You need to have at least one Edge Gateway with a **Deployed** status connected to your Control Plane. 
{{< /note >}}

## Step Two - Access the Dashboard

Go to the Control Plane overview and click the dashboard link in the Ingress list. You'll be redirected to the Tyk Dashboard for your [Control Plane](/docs/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-support/glossary/#control-plane).

## Step Three - Add a New API

Watch our video on Adding an API to your Tyk Cloud Dashboard.

Click the APIs menu item and then click **Add New API**.

## Step Four - Core Settings

1. Give Your API a name - We'll use "my app" for the rest of this Getting Started journey.
2. Scroll down to the **Target URL** setting and use the URL https://httpbin.org/
3. Then scroll down to the Authentication section and select **Open(Keyless)** to keep things simple for this demo.

## Step Five - Advanced Options

1. Click the **Advanced Options** tab of the API Designer.
2. Scroll to the **Segment Tags (Node Segmentation)** setting and add the edge tag (edge) you saw when creating the Edge Gateway.

### How Segment Tags work in Tyk Cloud

When an Edge Gateway is deployed, the tag 'edge' and a location tag are automatically generated for the Edge Gateway. You use these tags to connect your API to the appropriate Edge Gateway. It works as follows:

* Add the **edge** tag to your API to connect it to all Edge Gateways within the Control Plane.
* Add the location tag to your API to connect it to only Edge Gateways with that location within the Control Plane.

**Warning**
  
All APIs must be connected to an Edge Gateway by adding the appropriate tag in the **Segment Tags (Node Segmentation)** in the API Designer.

## Step Six - Save Your API

Click **Save** from the API Designer. Your API will now be added to the APIs list.

Next you'll access your API from the Gateway Ingress.
