## Introduction

This page shows how you can test an API that you have added to Tyk Cloud, to ensure that itâ€™s functioning correctly. You'll now access the API you setup in [Task 5](/docs/tyk-cloud/getting-started-tyk-cloud/first-api/) from the Edge Gateway within Tyk Cloud.


## Step One - Access the Gateway Ingress

From the Edge Gateway overview, copy the Ingress link and open it in a browser tab. You will get a 404 error.

## Step Two - Append the URL with your API

You created a API named **my app** in [Task 5](/docs/tyk-cloud/getting-started-tyk-cloud/first-api/). Add `/my-app/` to the end of the URL. You should be taken to https://httpbin.org/, which you added as the **Target URL** for the API in [Task 5](/docs/tyk-cloud/getting-started-tyk-cloud/first-api/#step-three---core-settings). 


Next you'll view the analytics for your API in the Dashboard.
