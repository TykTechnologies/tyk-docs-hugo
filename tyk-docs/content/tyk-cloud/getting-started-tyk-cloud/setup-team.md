## Introduction

You can use Tyk Cloud to manage your team as well as your APIs effectively and with minimal effort. Part of that process involves setting up your first team.

After creating your Organisation you'll land on the success screen. Click **Get Started**.

## Step One - Name your Team

Give your [Team](/docs/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-support/glossary/#team) a name. You may find it useful to reflect the names used within your organisation.

## Step Two - Invite your Users

Invite your [users](/docs/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-support/glossary/#user) to your team. You'll only need their email address and which of the available [roles](/docs/tyk-cloud/troubleshooting-support/glossary/#role) you want to assign to them. This step is optional and can be completed within the dashboard later.

Out of the box, the following roles are setup:

* **Team member**. They can manage deployment activity for the team they are added to.
* **Team admin**. They can manage deployment activity and users for the team they are added to.
* **Organisation admin**. They can manage deployment activity and users for a single organisation.

Next you'll create an Environment.
