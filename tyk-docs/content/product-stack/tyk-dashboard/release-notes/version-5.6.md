We are thrilled to announce new updates and improvements in Tyk 5.6.0, bringing more control, flexibility, and performance.  For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the detailed [changelog]({{< ref "#Changelog-v5.6.0">}}) below.

#### Per endpoint Rate Limiting for clients

Now you can configure rate limits at the [endpoint level per client]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#key-level-rate-limiting" >}}), using new configuration options in the access key. Use Tyk's powerful [security policies]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/what-is-a-security-policy" >}}) to create templates to set appropriate rate limits for your different categories of user.

#### Go upgrade to 1.22

We’ve upgraded the Tyk Dashboard to Golang 1.22, bringing improved performance, better security, and enhanced stability to the core system.

####  Strengthened Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) to combat privilege escalation risks

We’ve tightened up the rules that govern a user's ability to create admin users and to reset other users' passwords when using Tyk's RBAC function. Now, only super-admins can create new admins, admin roles can't be assigned to user groups, and only admin users can reset another user's password (and only within their Tyk Organisation).

<summary>Per endpoint client rate limiting</summary>

Building on the [per-endpoint upstream rate limits]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#api-level-rate-limiting" >}}) introduced in Tyk 5.5.0 we have now added [per-endpoint client rate limits]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#key-level-rate-limiting" >}}). This new feature allows for more granular control over client consumption of API resources by associating the rate limit with the access key, enabling you to manage and optimize API usage more effectively.

</details>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved documentation and schema for Tyk Dashboard API</summary>

We have updated the swagger.yml schema for Tyk Dashboard API to reflect the latest changes in product endpoints, payloads, and responses. This update includes new fields and endpoints, improved examples, documentation adjustments, and fixes for schema issues. These enhancements aim to improve usability and ensure that the documentation accurately represents the current code state.
</details>

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Addressed some display issues in Dashboard Analytics and Classic Portal when using PostgreSQL storage</summary>

- Resolved an issue where HTTP 429 status codes were not being displayed on the Activity Overview page.
- Fixed portal graphs by adding a default "day" grouping resolution to the query.
- Corrected issues with the Error Breakdown related to date parameters, ensuring accurate date handling and display.

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Dashboard didn't display correctly if more than 10 policies assigned to a key</summary>

We have resolved an issue where the Keys page would display a blank screen if a key was associated with more than 10 policies. The UI has been fixed to display the page properly, regardless of the number of policies attached to a key.

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Dashboard UI did not prevent multiple versions of a Tyk Classic API from being assigned to a policy</summary>

When working with Tyk Classic APIs, you cannot permit access to multiple versions of the same API from a single policy. We have fixed an issue in the Dashboard UI where users were able to attach multiple versions to a policy leading to an unusable policy. The UI now correctly prevents the addition of multiple versions of an API to a single policy.

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Dashboard didn't correctly record scope to policy mappings for JWTs</summary>

We have fixed an issue in the Dashboard UI when assigning multiple claim to policy mappings while configuring JWT auth for an API. The scope name was incorrectly recorded instead of the policy ID for the second and subsequent JWT scope mappings. The UI now correctly associates the defined claim with the appropriate policy, ensuring accurate JWT scope to policy mappings.

</details>
</li>

</ul>

#### Security Fixes
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list that should be included when any security fixes have been made in the release, e.g. CVEs. For CVE fixes, consideration needs to be made as follows:
1. Dependency-tracked CVEs - External-tracked CVEs should be included on the release note.
2. Internal scanned CVEs - Refer to the relevant engineering and delivery policy.
For agreed CVE security fixes, provide a link to the corresponding entry on the NIST website. For example:
- Fixed the following CVEs:
    - [CVE-2022-33082](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-33082)
-->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Strengthened RBAC password reset permissions</summary>

We have fixed a privilege escalation vulnerability where a user with certain permissions could potentially reset other users' passwords, including admin accounts. The following changes have been made to tighten the behavior of the password reset permission:
- All users can reset their own passwords
- A specific permission is required to reset the password of another user within the same Tyk Organisation
- This permission can only be assigned by an admin or super-admin
- This permission can only be assigned to an admin and cannot be assigned to a user group
- The allow_admin_reset_password configuration option automatically grants this permission to all admin users
- Super-admins always have the password reset permission across all Tyk Organisations

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Gateway secret could be exposed in debug logs</summary>

Resolved an issue where the Gateway secret was inadvertently included in the log generated by the Dashboard for a call to the `/api/keys` endpoint when in debug mode. This issue has been fixed to prevent sensitive information from appearing in system logs. We do not recommend running production environments in debug mode.
