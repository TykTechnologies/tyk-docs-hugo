This guide explains how to configure one or more custom plugins where the source code and associated configuration is co-located on Tyk Gateway’s file system. The process is similar to that for configuring the API Definition of a Tyk Classic API to use custom plugins.

---

## Overview

Using Tyk Classic APIs, developers can implement API-level custom plugins that can be optionally setup to execute for each of the following [hooks]({{< ref "plugins/plugin-types/plugintypes#plugin-and-hook-types" >}}) in the API request lifecycle: [Pre (Request)]({{< ref "plugins/plugin-types/request-plugins" >}}), [Authentication]({{< ref "plugins/plugin-types/auth-plugins/auth-plugins" >}}), [Post (Request)]({{< ref "plugins/plugin-types/request-plugins" >}}), [Post Authentication]({{< ref "plugins/plugin-types/request-plugins" >}}), [Response]({{< ref "plugins/plugin-types/response-plugins" >}}) and [Analytics]({{< ref "plugins/plugin-types/analytics-plugins" >}}). Subsequently, users can execute, or “hook”, their plugin into these phases of the API request lifecycle based on their specific use case.

This document explains how to configure the following plugin types with different drivers (plugin languages):
- Pre (Request)
- Authentication
- Post-Auth (Request)
- Post (Request)
- Response

Please refer to [Analytics Plugins]({{< ref "plugins/plugin-types/analytics-plugins" >}}) to learn how to configure Analytics plugins using Tyk Operator.

## How It Works {#tyk-classic}

In Tyk Classic APIs, the *custom_middleware* section of the Tyk Classic API Definition is where you configure plugins that will run at different points during the lifecycle of an API request.

The table below illustrates the Tyk Classic API configuration parameters that correspond to each phase of the API request lifecycle:

| Phase | Description       | Config Value |
| ----- | ---               | ----   |
| Pre   | Occurs before main request processing. | pre    |            
| Auth  | Custom authentication can be handled during this phase. | auth_check |  
| Post Auth | Occurs after key authentication | post_key_auth |
| Post | Occurs after the main request processing but before the response is sent. | post |       
| Response | Occurs after the main request processing but before the response is sent. | response |   

The example configuration below illustrates how to set up multiple plugins for different phases of the request lifecycle:

```json  {linenos=true, linenostart=1}
{
    "custom_middleware": {
        "pre": [
            {
                "name": "PreHook1",
                "path": "/path/to/plugin1.so",
                "require_session": false,
                "raw_body_only": false
            }
        ],
        "auth_check": {
            "name": "AuthCheck",
            "path": "/path/to/plugin.so",
            "require_session": false,
            "raw_body_only": false
        },
        "post_key_auth": [
            {
                "name": "PostKeyAuth",
                "path": "/path/to/plugin.so",
                "require_session": false,
                "raw_body_only": false
            }
        ],
        "post": [
            {
                "name": "PostHook1",
                "path": "/path/to/plugin1.so",
                "require_session": false,
                "raw_body_only": false
            },
            {
                "name": "PostHook2",
                "path": "/path/to/plugin2.so",
                "require_session": false,
                "raw_body_only": false
            }
        ],
        "response": [
            {
                "name": "ResponseHook",
                "path": "/path/to/plugin.so",
                "require_session": false,
                "raw_body_only": false
            }
        ],
        "driver": "goplugin"
    }
}
```

In the `custom_middleware` section of the API definition above we can see that there are Golang custom authentication (`auth_check`), post authentication (`post_key_auth`), post, pre and response plugins configured.

It can be seen that each plugin is configured with the specific function name and associated source file path of the file that contains the function. Furthermore, each lifecycle phase can have a list of plugins configured, allowing for complex processing workflows. For example, you might develop one plugin for logging and another for modifying the request in the pre request phase.

The `driver` configuration parameter describes the plugin implementation language. Please refer to the [supported languages]({{< ref "/plugins/supported-languages#plugin-driver-names" >}}) section for list of supported plugin driver names.

Each plugin can have additional settings, such as:
- `raw_body_only`: When true, indicates that only the raw body should be processed.
- `require_session`: When true, indicates that session metadata will be available to the plugin. This is applicable only for post, post authentication and response plugins.

### Unsupported

##### Per-Endpoint Plugins

At the endpoint-level, Tyk provides the facility to attach a custom Golang plugin at the end of the request processing chain (immediately before the API-level post-plugin is executed). Please note that [per-endpoint]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/endpoint-plugin" >}}) level plugins are not currently supported by Tyk Operator.

### Undocumented

##### Plugin Bundles

Tyk Operator also supports configuring custom plugins using plugin bundles, where the source code and associated configuration is packaged into a zip file and uploaded to a remote webserver. Tyk Gateway will then download, extract, cache and execute the plugin bundles for each of the configured phases of the [API request lifecycle]({{< ref "concepts/middleware-execution-order" >}}).

Currently, there are no examples documented for configuring plugin bundles with Tyk Operator. Please refer to [plugin bundles]({{< ref "plugins/how-to-serve-plugins/plugin-bundles" >}}) for further details of the equivalent Tyk Classic API configuration or reach out on the [community forum](https://community.tyk.io).

## Example: Configure Custom Plugins (JavaScript) With Tyk Operator

In this example we will create a JavaScript plugin that will inject a request header *Hello* with a value of *World*. This will be configured as a pre request [hook]({{< ref "" >}}).

### 1. Implement Plugin

The first step is to create the plugin source code. 

```javascript
var exampleJavaScriptMiddlewarePreHook = new TykJS.TykMiddleware.NewMiddleware({});

exampleJavaScriptMiddlewarePreHook.NewProcessRequest(function(request, session) {
    // You can log to Tyk console output by calling the built-in log() function:
    log("Hello from the Tyk JavaScript middleware pre hook function")
    
    // Add a request header
    request.SetHeaders["Hello"] = "World";

    // You must return both the request and session metadata 
    return exampleJavaScriptMiddlewarePreHook.ReturnData(request, {}  );
});
```

Copy the source code above and save it to the following file on the Gateway file system at `/opt/tyk-gateway/middleware/example-javascript-middleware.js`


### 2. Create API Definition Resource

The example API Definition resource listed below listens on path */httpbin* and forwards requests to upstream *http://httpbin.org*.

```yaml {linenos=table,hl_lines=["14-18"],linenostart=1}
apiVersion: tyk.tyk.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApiDefinition
metadata:
  name: httpbin
spec:
  name: httpbin
  use_keyless: true
  protocol: http
  active: true
  proxy:
    target_url: http://httpbin.org
    listen_path: /httpbin
    strip_listen_path: true
  custom_middleware:
    driver: otto # Javascript driver name
    pre:
      - name: "exampleJavaScriptMiddlewarePreHook"
        path: "middleware/example-javascript-middleware.js"
```

At lines 14-18 we can see the *custom_middleware* section contains the configuration for our plugin:

- The `driver` configuration parameter is set to `otto` at line 15, since our plugin is a Javascript plugin. For other valid values please refer to the [plugins driver page]({{< ref "plugins/supported-languages#plugin-driver-names" >}}).
- A plugin hook configuration block is specified at line 16, containing the `name` and `path` for our plugin. The plugin configuration block identifies the "hook" or phase in the API request lifecycle when Tyk Gateway will execute the plugin. In the example above the configuration block is for a `pre` request plugin that will be executed before any middleware.  Valid values are the same as the [Tyk Classic API Definition]({{< ref "#tyk-classic" >}}) equivalent, i.e. `pre`, `auth_check`, `post`, `post-auth` and `response`. We can see that the following fields are set within the `pre` plugin hook configuration object:

  - The `name` field represents the name of the function that implements the plugin in your source code. For Javascript plugins this must match the name of the middleware object that was created. In the example above we created the middleware object, `exampleJavaScriptMiddlewarePreHook`, by calling `var exampleJavaScriptMiddlewarePreHook = new TykJS.TykMiddleware.NewMiddleware({});`.
  - The `path` field contains the path to the source file `middleware/example-javascript-middleware.js`, relative to the base installation folder, i.e `/opt/tyk-gateway`.

Save the API Definition to file and create the APIDefinition resource:  

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f path_to_your_apidefinition.yaml
apidefinition.tyk.tyk.io/httpbin created
```

### 3. Test Plugin

We can test that our plugin injects a *Hello* header with a corresponding value of *World* by using the curl command:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/httpbin/headers
  {
    "headers": {
      "Accept": "*/*",
      "Accept-Encoding": "gzip",
      "Hello": "World",
      "Host": "httpbin.org"
    }
  }
```

The header `"Hello: World"` should be injected by the custom plugin.
