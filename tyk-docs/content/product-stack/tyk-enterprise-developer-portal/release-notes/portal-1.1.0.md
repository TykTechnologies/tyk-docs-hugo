**Licensed Protected Product**

### Support Lifetime
We strive to avoid any long term support arrangements for our enterprise portal. We run a regular 6 week release cadence which delivers new capability, extension of existing capability, and bug fix. Our policy is that we aim to avoid any breaking changes, so in effect the entire enterprise portal is supported. Here we'd increment our version as a minor version - 1.3.0, 1.4.0, 1.5.0 etc.

Occasionally, we may see a need to issue a critical fix if there is a systems down or a critical security defect. Here we would release this as soon as is physically possible, and the semantic versioning would reflect a patch (1.3.1, 1.4.1 etc).

The only exception to this policy is if we ever need to release a breaking change. This would mean that we have to release a new major version (i.e. releasing version 2.0). In this exceptional circumstance we would support both the old major version and the new one concurrently for six months - please note that the old version only gets supported in terms of critical fixes, not new functionality. After the six months is up, the previous major version falls out of support.

# Release Highlights
This release introduce a variety of features to improve developer experience. Additionally, we've included support for the S3 storage type as well as some bug fixes.

## Organization management for API Consumers
Now API Consumers can [create organizations]({{<ref "/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/managing-access/manage-api-consumer-organisations">}}) and securely share credentials between their teammates. In greater detail:
- API Consumers can request to upgrade their account to an organizational account.
- API Consumers can invite teammates to their organization and manage their roles.
- API Consumers in the same organization share access credentials so that the API Consumer team will still have access to API credentials even if an admin user is on vacation or left the organization.
- API Providers can configure whether they allow API consumers to request an upgrade to their accounts for an organizational account. 
- API Providers can manually accept, reject or configure to accept all such request to accepted by default.
 
## Get started guides
API Providers can add [Get started guides]({{<ref "/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started-with-enterprise-portal/manage-get-started-guides-for-api-products">}}) to API Products for better developer experiences:
- API Providers can add the **Get started guides** to API Products to speed-up onboarding of API Consumers.
- API Providers can use HTML or Markdown editors for authoring content for API Consumers such as the Get started guides and blog posts.

## Tags for API Products and blog posts
API Providers can select which blogs posts to display on an API Product page using [the tags feature]({{<ref "/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started-with-enterprise-portal/manage-get-started-guides-for-api-products#step-4-add-tags-to-blogs-and-api-products">}}). To achieve that, an API Provider can specify tags for both API Products and blog posts. Blog posts that match tags with an API Product are displayed in the 'Related blog content' section in the API Product page. This offers API Providers greater control over what blog posts to display on their API Product page.

## S3 support
We added [S3 support]({{<ref "/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/install-tyk-enterprise-portal/configuration#portal_storage">}}) for the portal assets storage (themes, images, OAS files). This update enhances the extensibility of our platform, allowing you to choose different storage solutions to better align with your specific needs.

# Changelog

## Added
- Added the [organization management capability]({{<ref "/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/managing-access/manage-api-consumer-organisations">}}) for API Consumers to safely share API access credentials between team members.
- Added the [Get started guides]({{<ref "/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started-with-enterprise-portal/manage-get-started-guides-for-api-products">}}) for API Products so that admins can explain to their consumers how use their API Products.
- Added support for [S3 storage]({{<ref "/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/install-tyk-enterprise-portal/configuration#portal_storage">}}) for the portal's assets storage. Now our customers can use `s3` storage in addition to the filesystem which is especially important in Kubernetes environments.
- Added [tags]({{<ref "/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/getting-started-with-enterprise-portal/manage-get-started-guides-for-api-products#step-4-add-tags-to-blogs-and-api-products">}}) for API Products and blog posts so that API Providers have greater control over which blog posts to display on their API Product page.


## Fixed
- Fixed a bug in the DCR flow where scopes from an API Product were not assigned to the OAuth2.0 client when creating a new OAuth2.0 client.
- Fixed a bug with the bootstrap process to print _JWT_ instead of the portalâ€™s internal auth token when bootstrapping the portal.
- Fixed a bug where plans and products were not removed for Tyk Dashboard instances that were disconnected from the portal instance. Subsequently, after this fix plans and products are only displayed for available Tyk Dashboard instances.
