#### Fixed
- Fixed the bug where the search bar in the My Apps section of the Developer dashboard didn't search for an application.
- Fixed the bug where it was possible to update read-only details of an API Product via an API call.
- Fixed the bug where deleting an access request credentials also deleted the access request.
- Fixed the bug where the button to save a link when editing a hyperlink in the admin UI in the text editor wasn't displayed.
- Fixed the bug where the Exports function didn't export analytics to a CSV file under the Error rate(average) tab in the developer Dashboard.
- Fixed the bug where the portal did not accept themes with names containing dots and displayed a not found error when uploading a theme with a dot in its name.
- Fixed the bug in a multi-pod deployment where, when a theme is uploaded, only the pod that uploaded it updates its theme list, while the other pods remain unaware of the new theme.
- Fixed the bug where the Portal allowed pages to be created with duplicate content block names. Subsequently, only the last content block with the duplicate name was displayed.
- Fixed the bug where the portal's page renderer ignored content-blocks under the `if` statement with references to multiple content-blocks (e.g. `{{ if and .blocks.Block1.Content .blocks.Block2.Content .blocks.Block3.Content }}`). Subsequently, content that depended on these conditional blocks would not be rendered.
- Fixed the bug where the product auth type is removed after a product is updated.
