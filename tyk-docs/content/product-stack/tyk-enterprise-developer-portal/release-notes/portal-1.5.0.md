### Support Lifetime
We strive to avoid any long term support arrangements for our enterprise portal. We run a regular 6 week release cadence which delivers new capability, extension of existing capability, and bug fix. Our policy is that we aim to avoid any breaking changes, so in effect the entire enterprise portal is supported. Here we'd increment our version as a minor version - 1.3.0, 1.4.0, 1.5.0 etc.

Occasionally, we may see a need to issue a critical fix if there is a systems down or a critical security defect. Here we would release this as soon as is physically possible, and the semantic versioning would reflect a patch (1.3.1, 1.4.1 etc).

The only exception to this policy is if we ever need to release a breaking change. This would mean that we have to release a new major version (i.e. releasing version 2.0). In this exceptional circumstance we would support both the old major version and the new one concurrently for six months - please note that the old version only gets supported in terms of critical fixes, not new functionality. After the six months is up, the previous major version falls out of support.

## Release Highlights
#### Improved API Providers page
Now the API Provider page has the Status and Last synced columns that help to digest the current status of an API Provider (Up, Down, or Unknown) and the last time it was synchronized. Now itâ€™s much easier to digest the current status of API Providers connected to the portal.

#### Add the SSL insecure skip verify flag for API Providers
With this new option, Tyk Enterprise Developer portal can be configured to use untrusted certificates when connecting the Tyk Dashboard which helps run local PoCs, quickly and easily.

#### New admin APIs
In 1.5.0 we introduced the following APIs:
- CRUD API for Get started guides.
- CRUD API for OpenAPI Spec for APIs included in API products.
- CRUD API for API Providers.

#### Better OAuth2.0 flow without the scope to policy mapping
{{< note >}}
This feature requires a patch to the gateway. In the 1.3.0 version of the portal, it's disabled. Once the 5.2 version of the gateway is released, we can confirm that the feature is fully functional. Stay tuned for updates!
{{< /note >}}
The improved OAuth2.0 allows API Providers to configure OAuth2.0 with scope to policy mapping and default No-Operation policies reducing the number of steps configure OAuth2.0 product in the Dashboard in the IdP by 17 steps from 19 to just 2 actions.

It also allows adding access to API Products to existing credentials. This way, if an API Consumer wants to add a new API Product to an existing credential, they can simply do it without the need to recreate them from scratch.
