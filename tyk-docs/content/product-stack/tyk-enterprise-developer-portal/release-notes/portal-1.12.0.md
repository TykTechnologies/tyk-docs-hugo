### Changelog {#Changelog-v1.12.0}

<!-- Required. The change log should include the following ordered set of sections below that briefly summarise the features, updates and fixed issues of the release.

Here it is important to explain the benefit of each changelog item. As mentioned by James in a previous Slack message (https://tyktech.slack.com/archives/C044R3ZTN6L/p1686812207060839?thread_ts=1686762128.651249&cid=C044R3ZTN6L):
"...it is important to document the customer impact for the work delivered, so we can share it with prospects/install base. For example:
"New Chart delivers x and y benefit to a and b customer use cases. The business impact for them will be this and that" -->

#### Added

<!-- This section should be a bullet point list of new features. Explain:

- The purpose of the new feature
- How does the new feature benefit users?
- Link to documentation of the new feature
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Embedded Tyk Identity Broker</summary>

From this release, you can configure the portal to serve an internal Tyk Identity Broker. This means that you don't need to deploy a separate Tyk Identity Broker service to SSO into the portal.
This enables a new section under the portal admin UI where admins can manage SSO profiles for admins and developers.
{{< img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/1.12.0-embedded-tib.png" width=500px alt="SSO profiles">}}

We support out of the box integration with the following SSO providers type:
- Open ID Connect: Support for OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Tokens provided by any standards compliant OIDC provider such as Auth0.
- LDAP: Bind users to an LDAP server such as Azure Active Directory, using their username and password.
- Social: The social provider should provide seamless integration with Google+ Github, Facebook, Salesforce, Digital Ocean and more.

You can read more about the supported SSO providers [here]({{< ref "/tyk-identity-broker" >}}).

<details>
<summary>Creation of Apps and Credentials</summary>

Admins now have enhanced control over application and credential creation in the portal, streamlining the onboarding process and reducing the need for API-based setups. With this update, admins can create applications and assign them to specific users, making it easier to onboard developers who aren’t using self-service options.

For custom authorization scenarios —like when using an external OAuth2.0 provider— admins can now issue credentials directly in the portal. These credentials are stored as key-value pairs that developers can view, providing a more seamless alternative to manual credential sharing.
{{< img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/1.12.0-non-tyk-managed-credential.png" width=500px alt="Non-Tyk managed credential">}}


Admins can also generate auth token credentials, with added flexibility to define custom token values if needed for compatibility with other systems. Additionally, OAuth2.0 credentials can now be created within the portal, ensuring stable, secure access for developers with the added benefit of immutability after creation.
{{< img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/1.12.0-custom-credential.png" width=500px alt="Custom credential">}}

Overall, these improvements simplify the process for managing applications and credentials, offering a more streamlined experience for admins and developers alike.

<details>
<summary>Password policy</summary>

Admins can now configure the password policy from the portal admin UI. This includes setting the minimum password length, reused passwords, multi case, and more.

</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Credentials notifications</summary>

Admins can now configure two types of notifications:
- Credential expiration: This notification is sent to developers when their credentials expire. You can modify the email template in the `keyexpired.tmpl` file included in the theme package.
- Credential expiration warnings: This notification is sent to developers when their credentials are about to expire. Admins can set the number of days before the expiration in the portal admin UI. You can modify the email template in the `keytoexpire.tmpl` file included in the theme package.
