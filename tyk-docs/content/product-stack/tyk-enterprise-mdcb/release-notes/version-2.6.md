Given the time difference between your upgrade and the release of this version, we recommend customers verify the ongoing support of third-party dependencies they install, as their status may have changed since the release.

#### Deprecations
Starting with MDCB v2.6.0, the configuration parameter `http_port` has been introduced to replace the original `healthcheck_port`. This new HTTP port is designed to expose various endpoints for monitoring and debugging MDCB.

###### Changes in MDCB v2.6.0:
- **New Configuration**: `http_port` is the new parameter for defining the HTTP port, with a default value of `8181`.
- **Deprecation**: The `healthcheck_port` parameter is deprecated and will no longer be used in future MDCB versions.
- **Helm Chart Update**: The MDCB Helm chart now includes the option `mdcb.probes.httpPort`, which takes precedence over `mdcb.probes.healthcheckPort`. For consistency and future compatibility, it is recommended to use `mdcb.probes.httpPort`.

###### Backward compatibility:

The `mdcb.probes.httpPort` parameter is backward compatible, meaning it will function correctly with all existing MDCB versions, ensuring a smooth transition.

###### Recommendations for users:

- **Update Configurations**: Modify your MDCB configurations to use the new `http_port` parameter.
- **Helm Chart Adjustments**: Update your Helm chart configurations to use `mdcb.probes.httpPort` instead of `mdcb.probes.healthcheckPort` to define the HTTP port.

###### Benefits:

- **Enhanced Monitoring and Debugging**: The new HTTP port facilitates better monitoring and debugging capabilities for MDCB. Exposed endpoints include:
  - /health - Provides the health status of MDCB.
  - /dataplanes - Provides information about the dataplanes connected to MDCB (`security.enable_http_secure_endpoints` must be enabled).
  - /debug/pprof/* - Provides profiling information (`enable_http_profiler` must be enabled).

By transitioning to the new `http_port` configuration, users will benefit from improved functionality and ensure compatibility with future MDCB releases.

#### Upgrade instructions
If you are using a 2.5.x version, we advise you to upgrade ASAP to this latest release. If you are on an older version, you should skip 2.5.0 and upgrade directly to this release.

#### Release Highlights

##### Tyk v5.4 Compatibility
MDCB 2.6.0 is an update for compatibility for synchronisation with Tyk v5.4 API Definitions.

##### Comprehensive Data Plane Node Information
MDCB 2.6 introduces a new `/dataplanes` endpoint that provides a comprehensive view of all data plane nodes connected to MDCB, including crucial metadata and status information for each node. The admin secret is required in the header to access these information.

 <details>
 <summary>Fixed MDCB failure when Tyk Dashboard is upgraded from v4 to v5</summary>
Fixed a bug where upgrading Tyk Dashboard from version 4 to version 5 caused an MDCB failure when using the default PostgreSQL protocol. Resolved the issue in MDCB by detecting cached plan errors, then reconnecting to the storage and rerunning the query to ensure proper functionality.

##### Added
<ul>
   <li>
 <details>
 <summary>Retrieve information of all the connected data plane nodes</summary>
   Adding a `/dataplanes` endpoint that offers a comprehensive view of all data plane nodes connected to MDCB. This endpoint provides crucial metadata and status information for each connected node, enabling efficient monitoring and troubleshooting. It requires an administrative key provided in the `x-tyk-authorization` header for access, ensuring secure and controlled usage. Successful requests return an array of node details, including node ID, API key, group ID, version, TTL, tags, health status, API statistics, and host details.
