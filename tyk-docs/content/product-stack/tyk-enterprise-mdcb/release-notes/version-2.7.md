Given the time difference between your upgrade and the release of this version, we recommend customers verify the ongoing support of third-party dependencies they install, as their status may have changed since the release.

#### Deprecations
There are no deprecations in this release, however with the introduction of new healthcheck endpoints we encourage customers to start using the new `/liveness` and `/readiness` endpoints and avoid using the old `/health` endpoint.

###### Recommendations for users:

- Migrate to new [health check]({{< ref "tyk-multi-data-centre/setup-controller-data-centre#health-check" >}}) endpoints in order to get more detailed information. For Kubernetes users, use Helm Charts v1.6 to upgrade MDCB to set liveness and readiness probes of MDCB deployment to the new health check endpoints.

#### Upgrade instructions
If you are using a 2.6.x version, we advise you to upgrade ASAP to this latest release. If you are on an older version, you should skip 2.6.0 and upgrade directly to this release.

#### Release Highlights

#### New Health check probes
Two new [health check]({{< ref "tyk-multi-data-centre/setup-controller-data-centre#health-check" >}}) endpoints have been added to improve monitoring and diagnostics:

1. `/liveness`: This endpoint provides a quick check to determine if the MDCB application is alive and running.
2. `/readiness`: This endpoint offers a detailed status of components and dependencies required for MDCB to serve traffic. It includes status checks for:
    - Database connectivity
    - Redis connectivity
    - RPC server status

These new endpoints allow for more granular monitoring of MDCB's operational status, enabling quicker identification and resolution of potential issues.

##### New Configuration Access Endpoint
Two new `/config` and `/env` [endpoints]({{< ref "tyk-multi-data-centre/setup-controller-data-centre#check-mdcb-configurations" >}}) have been implemented, allowing developers to access the current configuration state of the MDCB instance in real-time. This feature provides:

- Secure access to configuration data
- Automatic redaction of sensitive information
- Up-to-date view of the running configuration

This addition enhances debugging capabilities and provides valuable insights into the MDCB instance's current settings.
