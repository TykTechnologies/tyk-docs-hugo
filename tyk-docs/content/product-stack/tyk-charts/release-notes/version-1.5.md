#### Deprecations
<!-- Required. Use the following statement if there are no deprecations, or explain if there are -->
##### MDCB: Deprecated healthcheck_port and replaced with http_port

Starting with MDCB v2.6.0, the configuration parameter `http_port` has been introduced to replace the original `healthcheck_port`. This new HTTP port is designed to expose various endpoints for monitoring and debugging MDCB. The MDCB Helm chart now includes the option `mdcb.probes.httpPort`, which takes precedence over `mdcb.probes.healthcheckPort`. For consistency and future compatibility, it is recommended to use `mdcb.probes.httpPort`.

###### Backward compatibility:

The `mdcb.probes.httpPort` parameter is backward compatible, meaning it will function correctly with all existing MDCB versions, ensuring a smooth transition.

###### Recommendations for users:

- **Helm Chart Adjustments**: Update your Helm chart configurations to use `mdcb.probes.httpPort` instead of `mdcb.probes.healthcheckPort` to define the HTTP port.

<ul>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Gateway: Add option to enable fixed window rate limiter</summary>

New field `gateway.enableFixedWindowRateLimiter` added to `tyk-gateway` chart.

This feature allows users to enable fixed window rate limiter in the Gateway. The fixed window rate limiter feature permits requests up to the configured rate limit within a specified time window, after which any additional requests are blocked until the next window. This method has minimal impact on Redis and is straightforward to implement. However, it should be noted that it does not protect against traffic spikes as it lacks spike arrest behavior. The default value for this setting is `false`.

<details>
<summary>Dashboard and Gateway: Add init containers resources parameters</summary>

Optional parameters `dashboard.initContainers.initAnalyticsConf.resources` and `gateway.initContainers.setupDirectories.resources` added to set resources for init containers in Dashboard and Gateway charts respectively.

This feature is introduced to allow the definition of resource parameters for init containers, which is particularly useful in environments with namespace quotas that require specific resource definitions. Users can now specify the resources for init containers to comply with namespace resource quotas, ensuring that the init containers operate within the defined resource limits. The resource parameters can be defined at below locations.

Tyk Dashboard chart

```yaml
dashboard:
  initContainers:
    initAnalyticsConf:
      resources: {}
      # If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
      # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
      # limits:
      #   cpu: 100m
      #   memory: 128Mi
      # requests:
      #   cpu: 100m
      #   memory: 128Mi
```

Tyk Gateway chart

```yaml
gateway:
  initContainers:
    setupDirectories:
	    resources: {}
      # If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
      # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
      # limits:
      #   cpu: 100m
      #   memory: 128Mi
      # requests:
      #   cpu: 100m
      #   memory: 128Mi
```

<details>
<summary>MDCB: Added SSL configurations for MDCB HTTP server </summary>

Added `mdcb.httpServerOptions` for SSL configuration of the MDCB HTTP server.

This feature allows users to enable SSL for the MDCB HTTP server by configuring SSL-specific options. Users can enhance the security of their MDCB HTTP server by enabling SSL. The configuration includes settings such as `useSSL`, `certificateKeyFile`, `certificateCertFile`, and `minVersion`. For other HTTP server options, users can utilize `extraEnvs` to configure additional parameters.

```yaml
mdcb:
  # defines the SSL/TLS settings for the http server where the healthcheck is exposed
  httpServerOptions:
    # if enabled then the endpoints will be served over https
    useSSL: false
    # certificateKeyFile: /path-to-cert-keyfile
    # certificateCertFile: /path-to-certfile
    
    # For TLS 1.0 use 769, for TLS 1.1 use 770, for TLS 1.2 use 771, for TLS 1.3 use 772
    # minVersion: 771
```

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>MDCB: Deprecated Healthcheck Port and added HTTP Port </summary>

`mdcb.probes.httpPort` added to define the port used for accessing MDCB HTTP endpoints.

This change deprecates the previous healthcheck port in favor of using a defined HTTP port for accessing MDCB HTTP endpoints. This update streamlines the configuration by consolidating the HTTP endpoints under a single port setting, making it simpler to manage and configure the MDCB health checks.

```yaml
mdcb:
  probes:
    # This port lets MDCB allow standard health checks.
    # It also defines the path for liveness and readiness probes.
    # It is used to set TYK_MDCB_HEALTHCHECKPORT and TYK_MDCB_HTTPPORT when MDCB >= v2.6.0
    healthCheckPort: 8181
    
    # This is the preferred port setting for MDCB >= v2.6.0.
    # Users should use httpPort instead of healthCheckPort for newer versions.
    httpPort: 8181
```

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Add tyk-operator dependency to umbrella charts</summary>

`global.components.operator` added to determine whether the Tyk Operator component should be installed.

This feature adds a dependency on the Tyk Operator to the umbrella charts, facilitating the installation of the Tyk Operator component. Users can now easily install the Tyk Operator component by setting the `global.components.operator` parameter. Note that the Tyk Operator requires `cert-manager` to be installed beforehand. It also expects secret `tyk-operator-conf` is present in the installation namespace. You can enable bootstrapping at `global.components.bootstrap` if you are working on a new installation to have this secret created for you. Refer to the Tyk Operator [installation guide]({{<ref "tyk-stack/tyk-operator/installing-tyk-operator">}}) for detailed information on pre-requisites.

```yaml
global:
  components:
    # operator determines whether Tyk Operator component should be installed or not.
    # Tyk Operator needs cert-manager to be installed beforehand. Make sure that cert-manager is installed.
    # For further details, please refer to https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-stack/tyk-operator/installing-tyk-operator/
    operator: false
```

<li>
<details>
<summary>Add annotations to Tyk Stack and component Helm Charts</summary>

Introduced `annotations` values to the Tyk stack and component Helm charts to define annotations for Deployments or StatefulSets.

This enhancement allows users to define custom annotations for the Deployments or StatefulSets of Tyk components. Annotations are useful for supporting automated reloading of the Gateway or other components using tools like reloader. Previously, the Helm charts did not support any annotations at the deployment level.

Users can now add custom annotations to facilitate automation and improve the management of Tyk components. The following annotations have been added:
- Dashboard: `dashboard.annotations` for Tyk Dashboard Deployment/StatefulSet
- Dev Portal: `annotations` for Tyk Developer Portal Deployment/StatefulSet
- Gateway: `gateway.annotations` for Tyk Gateway Deployment/StatefulSet
- MDCB: `mdcb.annotations` for MDCB Deployment/StatefulSet
- Pump: `pump.annotations` for Tyk Pump Deployment

##### Fixed

<ul>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Dashboard: Fix misconfiguration preventing detail log display with Mongo Pump</summary>

This fix addresses a misconfiguration in the Dashboard chart that was causing the Log Browser not showing API activity logs for users utilizing Mongo Pump. The default configuration `dashboard.useShardedAnalytics` is now set to `true`, ensuring proper log visibility. Users who use Mongo Pump will now be able to view the API activity log as expected. Additionally, the correct Dashboard environment variable `TYK_DB_USESHARDEDANALYTICS` is now set using `dashboard.useShardedAnalytics`. This enhancement ensures accurate log visibility and improves the overall user experience with the Dashboard by properly configuring sharded analytics.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Gateway: Fix issue with control port and `latest` container image tag</summary>

Resolved an issue in the Gateway chart that prevented the use of a container image with the `latest` tag when `gateway.control.enabled` is set to `true`.

This fix addresses a problem in the Gateway chart where enabling the control port (`gateway.control.enabled`) would cause an error if the container image tag was set to `latest`. The helm chart template previously assumed that all images would use semantic versioning.

Users can now use the `latest` tag for container images even when the control port is enabled. This enhancement removes the restriction and assumption of semantic versioning, providing more flexibility in specifying container image tags.
