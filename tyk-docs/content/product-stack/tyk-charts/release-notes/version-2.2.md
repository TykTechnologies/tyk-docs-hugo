#### Changed

<ul>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Updated default versions of Tyk components</summary>

 Tyk Charts 2.2 will install the following Tyk component versions by default.

  - Tyk Gateway v5.3.8

</details>
</li>

</ul>

#### Fixed

<ul>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Gateway: Corrected template name for OpenTelemetry caFilePath</summary>

Corrected the template name for the OpenTelemetry caFilePath in the Gateway configuration.
Updated template reference from `otel-CAPath` to `otel-tlsCAPath` to ensure proper functionality.
This fix addresses misconfigurations related to the OpenTelemetry TLS CA path and ensures accurate rendering of Gateway templates.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>MDCB: Fixed MDCB service configuration when using LoadBalancer as the service type</summary>

The `externalTrafficPolicy` field is now correctly set under the spec section instead of selectors.
This fix ensures proper functionality and alignment with Kubernetes service configuration requirements.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Operator: Liveness and readiness probes failed due to deprecated ControllerManagerConfig CRD</summary>

Tyk Operator manifests used ControllerManagerConfig CRD to configure Operator Manager. However, the ControllerManagerConfig CRD has been deprecated in Tyk Operator v1.0 when we upgraded controller-runtime. Even though, operator runtime has default values for the configurations defined in CRD, deprecated CRD creates confusion for customers while deploying Tyk Operator.

This fix removed deprecated ControllerManagerConfig CRD from manifests and Operator runtime. It fixes liveness and readiness probes failure during upgrade.
</details>
</li>

</ul>
