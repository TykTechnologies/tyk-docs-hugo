Such information assists customers considering upgrading to a specific release.

Additionally, a disclaimer statement was added below the table, for customers to check that the third-party dependency they decide to install remains in support.

An example is given below for illustrative purposes only. Tested Versions and Compatible Versions information will require discussion with relevant squads and QA. -->

"New Chart delivers x and y benefit to a and b customer use cases. The business impact for them will be this and that" -->

#### Added
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list of new features. Explain:

- The purpose of the new feature
- How does the new feature benefit users?
- Link to documentation of the new feature
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Support for Custom OAuth Server Response Fields</summary>

This update enables the Tyk API Gateway to handle custom data fields from non-standard OAuth 2.0 token responses, like Salesforce’s instance_url. Users can now specify which custom fields to extract from the OAuth server response, storing them in request context for use in other Tyk middlewares. Custom fields are configurable within the API spec under extra_metadata.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Enhanced Stream Analytics Error Handling</summary>

Expanded Streams analytics to capture and report common error scenarios, including broker connectivity issues and standard HTTP errors, ensuring comprehensive request tracking for Streams-processed requests.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved Streams Analytics Integration</summary>

Expanded Streams analytics to capture and report common error scenarios, including broker connectivity issues and standard HTTP errors, ensuring comprehensive request tracking for Streams-processed requests.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Integrated Streams Validator with Streams API</summary>

Connected the new OAS validator to the /streams endpoint, adding proper error handling and validation responses for invalid stream configurations.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Extended Streams Configuration Validation</summary>

Extended the OAS validator to include Streams configuration validation, enforcing allowlisted components and validating nested broker configurations while implementing schema validation for Streams configurations.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>New Streams Configuration Validator</summary>

Introduced a new validator derived from the existing OAS schema, adapting it for Streams validation with modified requirements for upstreamURL and x-tyk-streaming fields. This validator is now used by both the Dashboard API streams endpoint and streams configuration validator.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved Logging for Streams</summary>

Refined streams logging behavior to match Tyk's logging patterns, reducing unnecessary log output and improving log clarity.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Simplified Streams Configuration Support</summary>

Implemented allowlist-based validation for components in streams configurations, replacing the previous blocklist approach. Supported components now include Kafka, WebSocket, SSE, and HTTP for both inputs and outputs (including broker combinations), along with JSON-Avro bidirectional conversion processors, while other components like scanners, caches, and buffers are blocked by default. This validation is enforced consistently across Gateway, Dashboard API, and UI.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

#### Fixed
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list that describes the issues fixed in the release. For each fixed issue explain:

- What problem the issue caused
- How was the issue fixed
- Link to (new) documentation created as a result of a fix. For example, a new configuration parameter may have been introduced and documented for the fix
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Resolved HTTP Input Timeout in Tyk Streams</summary>

When using Tyk Streams and sending input via http, the requests sometimes timed out causing a problem for the consumers. The issue has been fixed and now inputs via http for Tyk Streams work as intended.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved backwards compatibility when working with Tyk OAS APIs</summary>

Fixed a backwards compatibility issue with schema validation. When downgrading from a Tyk version, schema validation could fail as it didn't allow additional properties. This change relaxes schema strictness to again allow additional properties.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Optimized Gateway Handling for Large Payloads</summary>

Fixed a regression that increased memory consumption when proxying large response payloads, even with enable_detailed_recording disabled. The Gateway now handles large payloads more efficiently in terms of speed and memory usage.
</details>
</li>
</ul>


#### Security Fixes
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list that should be included when any security fixes have been made in the release, e.g. CVEs. For CVE fixes, consideration needs to be made as follows:
