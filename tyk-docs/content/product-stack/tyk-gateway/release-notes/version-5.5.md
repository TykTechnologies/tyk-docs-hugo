This release primarily focuses on bug fixes.
For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the detailed [changelog]({{< ref "#Changelog-vX.Y.0">}}) below.
-->
We are thrilled to introduce Tyk Gateway 5.5, bringing advanced rate-limiting capabilities, enhanced certificate authentication, and performance optimizations. For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the [changelog]({{< ref "#Changelog-v5.5.0">}}) below.

#### Per Endpoint Rate Limiting

Now configure rate limits at the endpoint level for both [Tyk OAS]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/endpoint-rate-limit-oas" >}}) and [Tyk Classic APIs]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/endpoint-rate-limit-classic" >}}), providing granular protection for upstream services against overloading and abuse.

#### Root CA Support for Client Certificates

Simplify certificate management with support for root Certificate Authority (CA) certificates, enabling clients to authenticate using certificates signed by the [configured root CA]({{< ref "basic-config-and-security/security/mutual-tls/client-mtls#can-i-register-a-root-certificate-authority-ca-certificate-with-tyk-so-that-tyk-will-validate-requests-with-certificates-signed-by-this-ca" >}}).

#### Optimised AST Document Handling

Experience improved performance with optimised creation and usage of Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) documents in our GQL library, reducing memory usage and enhancing efficiency.

### Changelog {#Changelog-v5.5.0}
<!-- Required. The change log should include the following ordered set of sections below that briefly summarise the features, updates and fixed issues of the release.

Here it is important to explain the benefit of each changelog item. As mentioned by James in a previous Slack message (https://tyktech.slack.com/archives/C044R3ZTN6L/p1686812207060839?thread_ts=1686762128.651249&cid=C044R3ZTN6L):
"...it is important to document the customer impact for the work delivered, so we can share it with prospects/install base. For example:
"New Chart delivers x and y benefit to a and b customer use cases. The business impact for them will be this and that" -->

#### Added
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list of new features. Explain:

- The purpose of the new feature
- How does the new feature benefit users?
- Link to documentation of the new feature
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Added root CA support for client certificate authentication</summary>

We've added support for you to register Certificate Authority (CA) certificates in your API definitions when using static mutual TLS (mTLS). Tyk can now authenticate clients presenting certificates signed by the registered root CA, simplifying certificate management for multiple clients sharing a common CA.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Optimised creation and usage of AST documents in GQL library</summary>

Optimised the creation and usage of AST documents in our GQL library to reduce significant memory allocations caused by pre-allocations during initial creation. These optimizations free up resources more efficiently, minimising performance penalties with increased requests to the Gateway.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Implemented upstream endpoint rate limits</summary>
 
Introduced new more granular controls for request rate limiting. Rate limits can now be configured at the endpoint level in Tyk OAS and Tyk Classic API definitions.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved handling of requests to non-existent versions of APIs when using URL path versioning</summary>
 
When using the URL path to indicate the API version (for example `/v1/my-api`) it is common to strip the version identifier (e.g. `/v1`) from the path before proxying the request to the upstream. If the client doesn't provide any version identifier this could lead to an invalid target URL and failed requests, rather than correctly redirecting to the default version. We have introduced an optional configuration `url_versioning_pattern` where you can specify a regex that Tyk will use to identify if the URL contains a version identifier and avoiding the accidental stripping of valid upstream path.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

#### Fixed
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list that describes the issues fixed in the release. For each fixed issue explain:

- What problem the issue caused
- How was the issue fixed
- Link to (new) documentation created as a result of a fix. For example, a new configuration parameter may have been introduced and documented for the fix
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Fixed an issue where transformation middleware could incorrectly be applied to Tyk OAS API endpoints with nested paths</summary>

Fixed an issue when using Tyk OAS APIs where nested API endpoints, such as '/test' and '/test/abc', might incorrectly apply middleware from the parent path to the nested path. The fix ensures that API endpoint definitions are correctly ordered so that the standard behaviour of Tyk is followed, whereby path matching is performed starting from the longest path, preventing middleware misapplication and ensuring both the HTTP method and URL match accurately.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Optimised key creation process to avoid unnecessary Redis `DeleteRawKey` commands</summary>

Previously, key creation or reset led to an exponential number of Redis `DeleteRawKey` commands; this was especially problematic for access lists with over 100 entries. The key creation sequence now runs only once, eliminating redundant deletion of non-existent keys in Redis. This optimization significantly reduces deletion events, enhancing performance and stability for larger access lists.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Resolved SSE streaming issue</summary>

Addressed a bug that caused Server Side Event (SSE) streaming responses to be considered for caching, which required buffering the response and prevented SSE from being correctly proxied.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Fixed analytics latency reporting for MDCB setups</summary>

 Resolved an issue where Host and Latency fields (Total and Upstream) were not correctly reported for Tyk Gateways in MDCB data planes. The fix ensures accurate Host values and Latency measurements are now captured and displayed in the generated traffic logs.
</details>
</li>
</ul>


#### Security Fixes
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list that should be included when any security fixes have been made in the release, e.g. CVEs. For CVE fixes, consideration needs to be made as follows:
1. Dependency-tracked CVEs - External-tracked CVEs should be included on the release note.
2. Internal scanned CVEs - Refer to the relevant engineering and delivery policy.

For agreed CVE security fixes, provide a link to the corresponding entry on the NIST website. For example:

- Fixed the following CVEs:
    - [CVE-2022-33082](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-33082)
-->

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>High priority CVEs fixed</summary>

Fixed the following high priority CVEs identified in the Tyk Gateway, providing increased protection against security vulnerabilities:
- [CVE-2023-39325](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39325)
- [CVE-2023-45283](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45283)
</details>
</li>
