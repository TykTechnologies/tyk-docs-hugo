-->
We are thrilled to announce new updates and improvements in Tyk 5.6.0, bringing more control, flexibility, and performance.  For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to the detailed [changelog]({{< ref "#Changelog-v5.6.0">}}) below.

#### Per endpoint Rate Limiting for clients

Now you can configure rate limits at the [endpoint level per client]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#key-level-rate-limiting" >}}), using new configuration options in the access key. Use Tyk's powerful [security policies]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/what-is-a-security-policy" >}}) to create templates to set appropriate rate limits for your different categories of user.

#### Gateway logs in JSON format

You can now output Tyk Gateway system logs in JSON format. This allows for easier integration with logging systems and more structured log data.

#### Go upgrade to 1.22

Weâ€™ve upgraded the Tyk Gateway to Golang 1.22, bringing improved performance, better security, and enhanced stability to the core system.

### Changelog {#Changelog-v5.6.0}
<!-- Required. The change log should include the following ordered set of sections below that briefly summarise the features, updates and fixed issues of the release.

Here it is important to explain the benefit of each changelog item. As mentioned by James in a previous Slack message (https://tyktech.slack.com/archives/C044R3ZTN6L/p1686812207060839?thread_ts=1686762128.651249&cid=C044R3ZTN6L):
"...it is important to document the customer impact for the work delivered, so we can share it with prospects/install base. For example:
"New Chart delivers x and y benefit to a and b customer use cases. The business impact for them will be this and that" -->

#### Added
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list of new features. Explain:

- The purpose of the new feature
- How does the new feature benefit users?
- Link to documentation of the new feature
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Per endpoint client rate limiting </summary>

Building on the [per-endpoint upstream rate limits]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#api-level-rate-limiting" >}}) introduced in Tyk 5.5.0 we have now added [per-endpoint client rate limits]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#key-level-rate-limiting" >}}). This new feature allows for more granular control over client consumption of API resources by associating the rate limit with the access key, enabling you to manage and optimize API usage more effectively.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>New option to generate Gateway system logs in JSON format</summary>

The Tyk Gateway now supports logging in JSON format. To enable this feature, set the environment variable `TYK_GW_LOGFORMAT` to `json`. If a different value is provided, the logs will default to the standard format. This enhancement allows for improved log processing and integration with various monitoring tools.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

#### Changed
<!-- This should be a bullet-point list of updated features. Explain:

- Why was the update necessary?
- How does the update benefit users?
- Link to documentation of the updated feature
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Upgrade to Go 1.22 for Tyk Dashboard</summary>

The Tyk Gateway and Tyk Dashboard have been upgraded from Golang 1.21 to Golang 1.22, bringing enhanced performance, strengthened security, and access to the latest features available in the new Golang release.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

#### Fixed
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list that describes the issues fixed in the release. For each fixed issue explain:

- What problem the issue caused
- How was the issue fixed
- Link to (new) documentation created as a result of a fix. For example, a new configuration parameter may have been introduced and documented for the fix
- For OSS - Link to the corresponding issue if possible on GitHub to allow the users to see further info.

Each change log item should be expandable. The first line summarises the changelog entry. It should be then possible to expand this to reveal further details about the changelog item. This is achieved using HTML as shown in the example below. -->
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved Gateway Synchronization with MDCB for Policies and APIs</summary>

We have enhanced the Tyk Gateway's synchronization with MDCB to ensure more reliable loading of policies and APIs. A synchronous initialization process has been implemented to prevent startup failures and reduce the risk of service disruptions caused by asynchronous operations. This update ensures smoother and more consistent syncing of policies and APIs from MDCB.
</details>
</li>
<li>
<details>
<summary>uota wasn't respected under extreme load</summary>

We have fixed an issue where the quota limit was not being consistently respected during request spikes, especially in deployments with multiple gateways. The problem occurred when multiple gateways cached the current and remaining quota counters at the end of quota periods. To address this, a distributed lock mechanism has been implemented, ensuring coordinated quota resets and preventing discrepancies across gateways.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Restored key creation performance to Gateway 4.0.12/4.3.3 levels</summary>

We have addressed a performance regression in gateway versions 4.0.13 and later, where key creation for policies with a large number of APIs (100+) became significantly slower. The operation, which previously took around 1.5 seconds in versions 4.0.0 to 4.0.12, was taking over 20 seconds in versions 4.0.13 and beyond. This issue has been resolved by optimizing Redis operations during key creation, restoring the process to its expected speed of approximately 1.5 seconds, even with a large number of APIs in the policy.
</details>
</li>
</ul>


<!-- #### Security Fixes -->
<!-- This section should be a bullet point list that should be included when any security fixes have been made in the release, e.g. CVEs. For CVE fixes, consideration needs to be made as follows:
1. Dependency-tracked CVEs - External-tracked CVEs should be included on the release note.
2. Internal scanned CVEs - Refer to the relevant engineering and delivery policy.
