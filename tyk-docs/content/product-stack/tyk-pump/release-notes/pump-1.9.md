## 1.9 Release Notes

### Release Date 5 Apr 2024

### Breaking Changes

##### Attention: Please read this section carefully

MongoDB v4.4 will reach its [end of life support](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/support-policy/lifecycles) at the end of February 2024. In order to support newer versions of MongoDB and align with newer versions of Tyk, we have changed the default MongoDB driver from [mgo](https://github.com/go-mgo/mgo) to [mongo-go](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver). The `mongo-go` driver supports MongoDB versions greater or equal to v4. **If you are using a version of MongoDB less than v4, please [follow this guide](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-pump#driver-type) to update the driver type to `mgo`.**

Users are strongly advised to follow the recommended [upgrade instructions](#upgrading-tyk) provided by Tyk before applying any updates.

### Deprecations

There are no deprecations in this release.

### Upgrade instructions

For users currently on v1.8.X, we strongly recommend promptly upgrading to the latest release. If you are working with an older version, it is advisable to bypass version 1.8 and proceed directly to this latest release.

### Release Highlights

#### Redis 7 and storage library

Tyk Pump now supports Redis v7, utilizing our [storage library v1.2.0](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/storage).

#### MongoDB Driver

As of v1.9, the default MongoDB driver has been changed from `mgo` to `mongo-go`.

#### AWS Simple Queue Service Support

Thanks to a community contribution by [masoudhaghbin](https://github.com/masoudhaghbin), Tyk Pump can now pump logs to an AWS SQS instance.

#### Tyk Graph Pump

There has been a significant enhancement in Tyk Graph Pump with the removal of the dependency on the `enable_detailed_recording` setting. This change is designed to streamline operations, reduce storage requirements and enhance overall performance in production environments. By decoupling detailed recording from specific configuration options, Tyk Graph Pump now provides greater flexibility and control over data storage.
