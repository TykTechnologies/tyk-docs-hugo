## <a name="intro"></a>Introduction
Depending on the version of Tyk you have installed, upgrading to the latest version works as follows:
## <a name="cloud"></a>Tyk Cloud
Tyk Cloud users are automatically upgraded to the latest version as soon as it's released.
## <a name="Multi-Cloud"></a>Tyk Multi-Cloud Gateway
We recommend you upgrade your Tyk Multi-Cloud Gateway in the following way:

 1. Take a backup of your tyk.conf, tyk-analytics.conf and start.sh files. This is important if you have modified your Docker Container in your current version.
 2. Re-run the start.sh script:

### For Mac OS Users
From a Terminal:

```{.copyWrapper}
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lonelycode/tyk-hybrid-docker/master/start.sh" -o "start.sh"
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh [PORT] [TYK-SECRET] [RPC-CREDENTIALS] [API CREDENTIALS]
```
### For Linux Users
```{.copyWrapper}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lonelycode/tyk-hybrid-docker/master/start.sh
chmod +x start.sh
sudo ./start.sh [PORT] [TYK-SECRET] [RPC-CREDENTIALS] [API CREDENTIALS]
```

This command will start the Docker container and be ready to proxy traffic (you will need to check the logs of the container to make sure the login was successful).

#### Parameters:
*   `PORT`: The port for Tyk to listen on (usually 8080).
*   `TYK-SECRET`: The secret key to use so you can interact with your Tyk node via the REST API.
*   `RPC-CREDENTIALS`: Your **Organisation ID**. This can be found from the System Management > Users section from the Dashboard. Click **Edit** on a User to view the Organisation ID.
*   `API-CREDENTIALS`: Your **Tyk Dashboard API Access Credentials**. This can be found from the System Management > Users section from the Dashboard. Click **Edit** on a User to view the Tyk Dashboard API Access Credentials. ![API key location][1]

#### Check everything is working

To check if the node has connected and logged in, use the following command:
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo docker logs --tail=100 --follow tyk_hybrid
```

  
This will show you the log output of the Multi-Cloud container, if you don't see any connectivity errors, and the log output ends something like this:
```
time="Jul  7 08:15:03" level=info msg="Gateway started (vx.x.x.x)"
time="Jul  7 08:15:03" level=info msg="--> Listening on port: 8080"
```

Then the Gateway has successfully re-started.

## <a name="on-premises"></a>Tyk On-Premises

In a production environment, where we recommend installing the Dashboard, Gateway and Pump on separate machines, you should upgrade components in the following sequence:

1. Tyk Dashboard
2. Tyk Gateway
3. Tyk Pump

Tyk is compatible with a blue-green or rolling update strategy.

For a single machine installation, you should follow the instructions below for your operating system.

Our repositories will be updated at [https://packagecloud.io/tyk](https://packagecloud.io/tyk) when new versions are released. As you set up these repositories when installing Tyk to upgrade all Tyk components  you can run:

### For Ubuntu

```{.copyWrapper}
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### For RHEL
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo yum update
```


> **Note**: For the Tyk Gateway before v2.5 and Tyk Dashboard before v1.5 there's a known Red Hat bug with init scripts being removed on package upgrade. In order to work around it, it's required to force reinstall the packages, e.g.:
`sudo yum reinstall tyk-gateway tyk-dashboard`

## Tyk Multi Data Centre Bridge

Our recommended sequence for upgrading a MDCB installation is as follows:

Master DC:

1. Dashboard
2. Gateway
3. MDCB

Then your Slave DC Gateways

Tyk is compatible with a blue-green or rolling update strategy.
