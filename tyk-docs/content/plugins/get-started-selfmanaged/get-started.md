This section takes you through the development process of creating a Custom Go Plugin.

At the end of this process you will have a Tyk environment running locally and a simple Go plugin executing on each API request.

Go plugins are the recommended plugin type and suitable for most use cases.
## Prerequisites

* docker & docker-compose
* [A Tyk license](https://tyk.io/sign-up/#self) (if using Self-Managed Tyk, which will make the process easier via UI)
* Make
* OSX (Intel)  -> Not a prerequisite, though these steps are tested on OSX Intel/ARM

This tutorial will take between 15-20 minutes.
