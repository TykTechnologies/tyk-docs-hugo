## Introduction

this page takes you through getting started with your first Custom Go Plugin.

* Run
* Test
* Deploy
* Automate

At the end of this process you will have a Tyk environment running locally and a simple Go plugin executing on each API request.

## Prerequisites

* docker & docker-compose
* A Tyk license.  
* Golang
* Make

The Open Source Gateway is of course capable of running Go plugins, but the specific get started repo we're using in this page is based on licensed Tyk.  You can self-service a 2-week trial license from our website.

This process will take between 15-20 minutes.
