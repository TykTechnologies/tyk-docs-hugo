Welcome to the Tyk Plugins Hub, dedicated to providing you with a curated list of resources that showcase how to develop Tyk Plugins. 

[Tyk Plugins]({{< ref "plugins" >}}) are a powerful tool that allows you to develop custom middleware that can intercept requests at different stages of the request lifecycle, modifying/transforming headers and body content.

Tyk has extensive support for writing custom plugins using a wide range of languages, most notably: Go, Python, Javascript etc. In fact, plugins can be developed using most languages via *gRPC*.

## Blogs

Selected blogs for plugin development are included below. Further examples are available at the Tyk [website](https://tyk.io/?s=plugin).

#### 1. [Decoupling micro-services using Message-based RPC](https://medium.com/@asoorm/decoupling-micro-services-using-message-based-rpc-fa1c12409d8f)
- **Summary**: Explains how to write a plugin that intercepts an API request and forwards it to a gRPC server. The gRPC server processes the request and dispatches work to an RabbitMQ message queue. The source code is available in the accompanying [GitHub repository](https://github.com/asoorm/tyk-rmq-middleware)

#### 2. [How to configure a gRPC server using Tyk](https://tyk.io/blog/how-to-configure-a-grpc-server-using-tyk/)
- **Summary**: Explains how to configure a Python implementation of a gRPC server to add additional logic to API requests. During the request lifecycle, the Tyk-Gateway acts as a gRPC client that contacts the Python gRPC server, providing additional custom logic.

#### 3. [How to deploy Python plugins in Tyk running On Kubernetes](https://tyk.io/blog/how-to-deploy-python-plugins-in-tyk-running-on-kubernetes/)
- **Summary**: Explains how to deploy a custom Python plugin into a Tyk installation running on a Kubernetes cluster.

## GitHub Repositories

Here are some carefully selected GitHub repositories that will help you learn how to integrate and utilise Tyk Plugins in your development projects:

#### 1. [Tyk Awesome Plugins](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-awesome-plugins)
- **Description**: Index of plugins developed using a variety of languages.
- **Key Features Demonstrated**: A comprehensive index for a collection of plugins that can be used with the Tyk API Gateway in areas such as: rate limiting, authentication and request transformation. The examples are developed using a diverse array of languages, including but not limited to: Python, JavaScript and Go. This broad language support ensures that developers from different backgrounds and with various language preferences can seamlessly integrate these plugins with their Tyk API Gateway implementations.

#### 2. [Custom Plugin Examples](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/custom-plugin-examples/tree/master)
- **Description**: Index of examples for a range of plugin hooks (Pre, Post, Post-Auth and Response) developed using a variety of languages.
- **Key Features Demonstrated**: Specific examples include invoking an AWS lambda, inserting a new claim into a JWT, inject a signed JWT into authorization header, request header modification. A range of examples are available including Python, Java, Ruby, Javascript, NodeJS and Go.

#### 3. [Environment For Plugin Development](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/custom-go-plugin)
- **Description**: Provides a docker-compose environment for developing your own custom Go plugins.
- **Key Features Demonstrated**: Showcases support for bundling plugins, uploading plugins to AWS S3 storage, test coverage etc.
