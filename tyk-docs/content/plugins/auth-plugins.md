The ID Extractor is a caching mechanism that's used in combination with Tyk Plugins. It can be used specifically with plugins that implement custom authentication mechanisms. The ID Extractor works for all rich plugins: gRPC-based plugins, Python and Lua.

See [ID Extractor](https://tyk.io/docs/customise-tyk/plugins/rich-plugins/id-extractor/) for more details.
