This quick start explains how to run the [getting started](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/custom-go-plugin) Go plugin within Tyk Dashboard.

**Estimated time**: 10-15 minutes

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

1. Add your Tyk license.
2. Bootstrap the Tyk Dashboard environment.
3. Login to Tyk Dashboard.
4. View the pre-configured API.
5. Test the plugin.
6. View the analytics.
7. Next steps.

## 1. Add your Tyk license

Create and edit the file `.env` with your Tyk Dashboard license key

```console
# Make a copy of the example .env file for the Tyk-Dashboard 
cp .env.example .env
```

## 2. Bootstrap the getting started example

run the `make` command:

```bash
make
```

This will take a few minutes to run as it compiles the plugin for the first time and downloads all the necessary Docker images.

## 3. Log in to Tyk Dashboard

Log on to the Tyk Dashboard on `http://localhost:3000` using the following Bootstrapped credentials:
```
demo@tyk.io
```
and password:
```
topsecretpassword
```

Note: these are editable in `.env.example`

## 4. View the pre-configured API

Once you're logged on to the Tyk Dashboard, navigate to the *APIs* screen.

You'll see a sample *Httpbin* API.  Let's click into it for more details.

Click on *VIEW RAW DEFINITION*.  Note the *custom_middleware* block is filled out, injecting the compiled example Go plugin into the API.

## 5. Test the plugin

Let's send an API request to the API Gateway so it can reverse proxy to our API.

```terminal
curl localhost:8080/httpbin/get
```

Yields the response:
```
{
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip",
    "Foo": "Bar",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.79.1",
    "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-63f78c47-51e22c5b57b8576b1225984a"
  },
  "origin": "172.26.0.1, 99.242.70.243",
  "url": "http://httpbin.org/get"
}
```

Note, we see a *Foo:Bar* HTTP Header was injected by our Go plugin and echoed back to us by the Httpbin mock server.

## 6. View the analytics

Navigate to the Dashboard's various *API Usage Data* to view analytics on the API request!

## 7. Next steps

Try updating the code of the plugin and experimenting. Once you've made changes to the example plugin, please run `make build` to compile the plugin and reload the gateway with the changes.

When finished, please run `make down` to bring down the stack.
