## Overview

Tyk streams configuration is specified using YAML. The configuration consists of several main sections: *input*, *pipeline*, *output* and optionally *logger*.

### Input

The input section defines the publisher source of the data stream. Tyk Streams supports various input types such as Kafka, HTTP, MQTT etc. Each input type has specific configuration parameters.

```yaml
input:
  kafka:
    addresses:
      - localhost:9092
    topics:
      - example_topic
    consumer_group: example_group
    client_id: example_client
```

### Pipeline

The pipeline section defines the processing steps applied to the data. It includes processors for filtering, mapping, enriching and transforming the data. Processors can be chained together.

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        root = this
        root.foo = this.bar.uppercase()
    - json_schema:
        schema_path: "./schemas/example_schema.json"
```

### Output

The output section specifies the destination of the processed data. Similar to inputs, Tyk Streams supports various output types like Kafka, HTTP etc.

```yaml
output:
  kafka:
    addresses:
      - localhost:9092
    topic: output_topic
    client_id: example_output_client
```

### Logger (Optional)

The logger section is used to configure logging options, such as log level and output format.

```yaml
logger:
  level: INFO
  format: json
```

## Inputs

### Overview

An input is a source of data piped through an array of optional [processors]({{< ref "api-management/stream-config#overview-3" >}}):

```yaml
input:
  label: my_kafka_input

  kafka:
    addresses: [ localhost:9092 ]
    topics: [ foo, bar ]
    consumer_group: foogroup

  # Optional list of processing steps
  processors:
    - avro:
        operator: to_json
```

#### Brokering

Only one input is configured at the root of a Tyk Streams config. However, the root input can be a [broker]({{< ref "api-management/stream-config#broker" >}}) which combines multiple inputs and merges the streams:

```yaml
input:
  broker:
    inputs:
      - kafka:
          addresses: [ localhost:9092 ]
          topics: [ foo, bar ]
          consumer_group: foogroup

      - http_client:
          url: https://localhost:8085
          verb: GET
          stream:
            enabled: true
```

#### Labels

Inputs have an optional field `label` that can uniquely identify them in observability data such as logs.

<!-- TODO

When know if Tyk Streams will support metrics then link to metrics

Inputs have an optional field `label` that can uniquely identify them in observability data such as metrics and logs. This can be useful when running configs with multiple inputs, otherwise their metrics labels will be generated based on their composition. For more information check out the [metrics documentation][metrics.about].

-->

### Broker

Allows you to combine multiple inputs into a single stream of data, where each input will be read in parallel.

#### Common

```yml
# Common config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  broker:
    inputs: [] # No default (required)
    batching:
      count: 0
      byte_size: 0
      period: ""
      check: ""
```

##Â Advanced

```yml
# All config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  broker:
    copies: 1
    inputs: [] # No default (required)
    batching:
      count: 0
      byte_size: 0
      period: ""
      check: ""
      processors: [] # No default (optional)
```

A broker type is configured with its own list of input configurations and a field to specify how many copies of the list of inputs should be created.

Adding more input types allows you to combine streams from multiple sources into one. For example, reading from both RabbitMQ and Kafka:

```yaml
input:
  broker:
    copies: 1
    inputs:
      - amqp_0_9:
          urls:
            - amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/
          consumer_tag: tyk-consumer
          queue: tyk-queue

        # Optional list of input specific processing steps
        processors:
          - mapping: |
              root.message = this
              root.meta.link_count = this.links.length()
              root.user.age = this.user.age.number()

      - kafka:
          addresses:
            - localhost:9092
          client_id: tyk_kafka_input
          consumer_group: tyk_consumer_group
          topics: [ tyk_stream:0 ]
```

If the number of copies is greater than zero the list will be copied that number of times. For example, if your inputs were of type foo and bar, with 'copies' set to '2', you would end up with two 'foo' inputs and two 'bar' inputs.

##### Batching

It's possible to configure a [batch policy]({{< ref "api-management/stream-config#batch-policy" >}}) with a broker using the `batching` fields. When doing this the feeds from all child inputs are combined. Some inputs do not support broker based batching and specify this in their documentation.

##### Processors

It is possible to configure processors at the broker level, where they will be applied to *all* child inputs, as well as on the individual child inputs. If you have processors at both the broker level *and* on child inputs then the broker processors will be applied *after* the child nodes processors.

#### Fields

##### copies

Whatever is specified within `inputs` will be created this many times.


Type: `int`
Default: `1`

##### inputs

A list of inputs to create.


Type: `array`

##### batching

Allows you to configure a [batching policy]({{< ref "api-management/stream-config#batch-policy" >}}).


Type: `object`

```yml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

##### batching.count

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


Type: `int`
Default: `0`

##### batching.byte_size

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


Type: `int`
Default: `0`

##### batching.period

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


Type: `string`
Default: `""`

```yml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

<!-- TODO: when bloblang is supported
##### batching.check

A Bloblang query that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


Type: `string`
Default: `""`

```yml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```
-->

##### batching.processors

A list of processors to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


Type: `array`

```yml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array
```

### Http Client

Connects to a server and continuously performs requests for a single message.

#### Common

```yml
# Common config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  http_client:
    url: "" # No default (required)
    verb: GET
    headers: {}
    timeout: 5s
    payload: "" # No default (optional)
    stream:
      enabled: false
      reconnect: true
    auto_replay_nacks: true
```

#### Advanced

```yml
# All config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  http_client:
    url: "" # No default (required)
    verb: GET
    headers: {}
    metadata:
      include_prefixes: []
      include_patterns: []
    dump_request_log_level: ""
    oauth:
      enabled: false
      consumer_key: ""
      consumer_secret: ""
      access_token: ""
      access_token_secret: ""
    oauth2:
      enabled: false
      client_key: ""
      client_secret: ""
      token_url: ""
      scopes: []
      endpoint_params: {}
    basic_auth:
      enabled: false
      username: ""
      password: ""
    jwt:

      claims: {}
      headers: {}
    tls:
      enabled: false
      skip_cert_verify: false
      enable_renegotiation: false
      root_cas: ""
      root_cas_file: ""
      client_certs: []
    extract_headers:
      include_prefixes: []
      include_patterns: []
    timeout: 5s
    retry_period: 1s
    max_retry_backoff: 300s
    retries: 3
    backoff_on:
      - 429
    drop_on: []
    successful_on: []
    proxy_url: "" # No default (optional)
    payload: "" # No default (optional)
    drop_empty_bodies: true
    stream:
      enabled: false
      reconnect: true
    auto_replay_nacks: true
```

##### Streaming

If you enable streaming then Tyk Streams will consume the body of the response as a continuous stream of data. This allows you to consume APIs that provide long lived streamed data feeds (such as Twitter).

##### Pagination

This input supports interpolation functions in the `url` and `headers` fields where data from the previous successfully consumed message (if there was one) can be referenced. This can be used in order to support basic levels of pagination.

#### Examples

##### Basic Pagination

Interpolation functions within the `url` and `headers` fields can be used to reference the previously consumed message, which allows simple pagination.

```yaml
input:
  http_client:
    url: >-
      http://api.example.com/search?query=allmyfoos&start_time=${! (
        (timestamp_unix()-300).ts_format("2006-01-02T15:04:05Z","UTC").escape_url_query()
      ) }${! ("&next_token="+this.meta.next_token.not_null()) | "" }
    verb: GET
```

<!--

Update example when Tyk secrets Stream release has been performed

```yaml
input:
  http_client:
    url: >-
      http://api.example.com/search?query=allmyfoos&start_time=${! (
        (timestamp_unix()-300).ts_format("2006-01-02T15:04:05Z","UTC").escape_url_query()
      ) }${! ("&next_token="+this.meta.next_token.not_null()) | "" }
    verb: GET
    rate_limit: foo_searches
    # oauth2:
    #   enabled: true
    #   token_url: https://api.example.com/oauth2/token
    #   client_key: "${EXAMPLE_KEY}"
    #   client_secret: "${EXAMPLE_SECRET}"

Type: `array`
Default: `[429]`

##### drop_on

A list of status codes whereby the request should be considered to have failed but retries should not be attempted. This is useful for preventing wasted retries for requests that will never succeed. Note that with these status codes the *request* is dropped, but *message* that caused the request will not be dropped.


Type: `array`
Default: `[]`

##### successful_on

A list of status codes whereby the attempt should be considered successful, this is useful for dropping requests that return non-2XX codes indicating that the message has been dealt with, such as a 303 See Other or a 409 Conflict. All 2XX codes are considered successful unless they are present within `backoff_on` or `drop_on`, regardless of this field.


Type: `array`

##### stream.reconnect

Sets whether to re-establish the connection once it is lost.


Type: `bool`
Default: `true`


##### auto_replay_nacks

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.


Type: `bool`
Default: `true`

### HTTP Server

Receive messages POSTed over HTTP(S). HTTP 2.0 is supported when using TLS, which is enabled when key and cert files are specified.

#### Common

```yml
# Common config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  http_server:
    address: ""
    path: /post
    ws_path: /post/ws
    allowed_verbs:
      - POST
    timeout: 5s
```

#### Advanced

```yml
# All config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  http_server:
    address: ""
    path: /post
    ws_path: /post/ws
    ws_welcome_message: ""
    allowed_verbs:
      - POST
    timeout: 5s
    cert_file: ""
    key_file: ""
    cors:
      enabled: false
      allowed_origins: []
    sync_response:
      status: "200"
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/octet-stream
      metadata_headers:
        include_prefixes: []
        include_patterns: []
```

<!-- TODO add link to service wide HTTP server If the `address` config field is left blank the [service-wide HTTP server](/docs/components/http/about) will be used. -->

<!-- TODO add rate limit The field `rate_limit` allows you to specify an optional [`rate_limit` resource](/docs/components/rate_limits/about), which will be applied to each HTTP request made and each websocket payload received.

When the rate limit is breached HTTP requests will have a 429 response returned with a Retry-After header. Websocket payloads will be dropped and an optional response payload will be sent as per `ws_rate_limit_message`. -->

##### Responses

<!-- TODO describe how to use synchronous responses when avail:

It's possible to return a response for each message received using synchronous responses. When doing so you can customise headers with the `sync_response` field `headers`, which can also use function interpolation in the value based on the response message contents.
 -->


##### Endpoints

The following fields specify endpoints that are registered for sending messages, and support path parameters of the form `/{foo}`, which are added to ingested messages as metadata. A path ending in `/` will match against all extensions of that path:

###### path (defaults to `/post`)

This endpoint expects POST requests where the entire request body is consumed as a single message.

If the request contains a multipart `content-type` header as per [rfc1341](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html) then the multiple parts are consumed as a batch of messages, where each body part is a message of the batch.

###### ws_path (defaults to `/post/ws`)

Creates a websocket connection, where payloads received on the socket are passed through the pipeline as a batch of one message.

Please note that components within a Tyk Streams config will register their respective endpoints in a non-deterministic order. This means that establishing precedence of endpoints that are registered via multiple `http_server` inputs or outputs (either within brokers or from cohabiting streams) is not possible in a predictable way.

This ambiguity makes it difficult to ensure that paths which are both a subset of a path registered by a separate component, and end in a slash (`/`) and will therefore match against all extensions of that path, do not prevent the more specific path from matching against requests.

It is therefore recommended that you ensure paths of separate components do not collide unless they are explicitly non-competing.

For example, if you were to deploy two separate `http_server` inputs, one with a path `/foo/` and the other with a path `/foo/bar`, it would not be possible to ensure that the path `/foo/` does not swallow requests made to `/foo/bar`.

You may specify an optional `ws_welcome_message`, which is a static payload to be sent to all clients once a websocket connection is first established.

##### Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

``` text
- http_server_user_agent
- http_server_request_path
- http_server_verb
- http_server_remote_ip
- All headers (only first values are taken)
- All query parameters
- All path parameters
- All cookies
```

If HTTPS is enabled, the following fields are added as well:
``` text
- http_server_tls_version
- http_server_tls_subject
- http_server_tls_cipher_suite
```

<!-- TODO: when interpolaion supported
You can access these metadata fields using interpolation functions.
-->

#### Examples


##### Path Switching

This example shows an `http_server` input that captures all requests and processes them by switching on that path:

```yaml
input:
  http_server:
    path: /
    allowed_verbs: [ GET, POST ]
    sync_response:
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/json

  processors:
    - switch:
      - check: '@http_server_request_path == "/foo"'
        processors:
          - mapping: |
              root.title = "You Got Fooed!"
              root.result = content().string().uppercase()

      - check: '@http_server_request_path == "/bar"'
        processors:
          - mapping: 'root.title = "Bar Is Slow"'
          - sleep: # Simulate a slow endpoint
              duration: 1s
```

##### Mock OAuth 2.0 Server

This example shows an `http_server` input that mocks an OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow server at the endpoint `/oauth2_test`:

```yaml

    allowed_verbs: [ GET, POST ]
    sync_response:
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/json

  processors:
    - log:
        message: "Received request"
        level: INFO
        fields_mapping: |
          root = @
          root.body = content().string()

        root.access_token = "MTQ0NjJkZmQ5OTM2NDE1ZTZjNGZmZjI3"
        root.token_type = "Bearer"
        root.expires_in = 3600

      byte_size: 0
      period: ""
      check: ""
      processors: [] # No default (optional)
```

Offsets are managed within Kafka under the specified consumer group, and partitions for each topic are automatically balanced across members of the consumer group.

The Kafka input allows parallel processing of messages from different topic partitions, and messages of the same topic partition are processed with a maximum parallelism determined by the field [checkpoint_limit](#checkpoint_limit).

In order to enforce ordered processing of partition messages set the [checkpoint_limit](#checkpoint_limit) to `1` and this will force partitions to be processed in lock-step, where a message will only be processed once the prior message is delivered.

Batching messages before processing can be enabled using the [batching](#batching) field, and this batching is performed per-partition such that messages of a batch will always originate from the same partition. This batching mechanism is capable of creating batches of greater size than the [checkpoint_limit](#checkpoint_limit), in which case the next batch will only be created upon delivery of the current one.

##### Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

``` text
- kafka_key
- kafka_topic
- kafka_partition
- kafka_offset
- kafka_lag
- kafka_timestamp_unix
- kafka_tombstone_message
- All existing message headers (version 0.11+)
```

The field `kafka_lag` is the calculated difference between the high water mark offset of the partition at the time of ingestion and the current message offset.

<!-- TODO: when interpolation supported
You can access these metadata fields using function interpolation.
-->

##### Ordering

By default messages of a topic partition can be processed in parallel, up to a limit determined by the field `checkpoint_limit`. However, if strict ordered processing is required then this value must be set to 1 in order to process shard messages in lock-step. When doing so it is recommended that you perform batching at this component for performance as it will not be possible to batch lock-stepped messages at the output level.

##### Troubleshooting

- I'm seeing logs that report `Failed to connect to kafka: kafka: client has run out of available brokers to talk to (Is your cluster reachable?)`, but the brokers are definitely reachable.

Unfortunately this error message will appear for a wide range of connection problems even when the broker endpoint can be reached. Double check your authentication configuration and also ensure that you have [enabled TLS](#tlsenabled) if applicable.

#### Fields

##### addresses

A list of broker addresses to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple addresses.


Type: `array`

```yml

addresses:
  - localhost:9041
  - localhost:9042
```

##### topics

A list of topics to consume from. Multiple comma separated topics can be listed in a single element. Partitions are automatically distributed across consumers of a topic. Alternatively, it's possible to specify explicit partitions to consume from with a colon after the topic name, e.g. `foo:0` would consume the partition 0 of the topic foo. This syntax supports ranges, e.g. `foo:0-10` would consume partitions 0 through to 10 inclusive.


Type: `array`
Requires version 3.33.0 or newer

```yml
# Examples

topics:
  - foo

Type: `int`
Default: `1024`
Requires version 3.33.0 or newer

##### auto_replay_nacks

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

```
-->

##### batching.processors

A list of processors to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.

An output is a sink where we wish to send our consumed data after applying an optional array of [processors]({{< ref "api-management/stream-config#overview-3" >}}). Only one output is configured at the root of a Tyk Streams config. However, the output can be a [broker]({{< ref "api-management/stream-config#broker-1" >}}) which combines multiple outputs under a chosen brokering pattern.

An output config section looks like this:

```yaml
outout:
  label: my_kafka_output

  kafka:
    addresses: [ localhost:9092 ]
    topic: "foobar"

  # Optional list of processing steps
  processors:
    - avro:
        operator: from_json
```

#### Labels

Outputs have an optional field `label` that can uniquely identify them in observability data such as logs.

<!--

TODO replace with this paragraph when determine if product supports metrics

Outputs have an optional field `label` that can uniquely identify them in observability data such as metrics and logs. This can be useful when running configs with multiple outputs, otherwise their metrics labels will be generated based on their composition. For more information check out the [metrics documentation][metrics.about].

-->

### Broker

Allows you to route messages to multiple child outputs using a range of brokering [patterns](#patterns).

#### Common

```yml
# Common config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  broker:
    pattern: fan_out
    outputs: [] # No default (required)
    batching:
      count: 0
      byte_size: 0
      period: ""
      check: ""
```

#### Advanced

```yml
# All config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  broker:
    copies: 1
    pattern: fan_out
    outputs: [] # No default (required)
    batching:
      count: 0
      byte_size: 0
      period: ""
      check: ""
      processors: [] # No default (optional)
```

Processors can be listed to apply across individual outputs or all outputs:

```yaml
output:
  broker:
    pattern: fan_out
    outputs:
      - resource: foo
      - resource: bar
        # Processors only applied to messages sent to bar.
        processors:
          - resource: bar_processor

  # Processors applied to messages sent to all brokered outputs.
  processors:
    - resource: general_processor
```

#### Fields

##### copies

The number of copies of each configured output to spawn.


Type: `int`
Default: `1`

##### pattern

The brokering pattern to use.


Type: `string`
Default: `"fan_out"`
Options: `fan_out`, `fan_out_fail_fast`, `fan_out_sequential`, `fan_out_sequential_fail_fast`, `round_robin`, `greedy`.

##### outputs

A list of child outputs to broker.


Type: `array`

##### batching

Allows you to configure a [batching policy]({{< ref "api-management/stream-config#batch-policy" >}}).


Type: `object`

```yml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

##### batching.count

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.


Type: `int`
Default: `0`

##### batching.byte_size

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.


Type: `int`
Default: `0`

##### batching.period

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.


Type: `string`
Default: `""`

```yml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

<!-- TODO: when bloblang is supported
##### batching.check

A Bloblang query that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


Type: `string`
Default: `""`

```yml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```
-->

##### batching.processors

A list of processors to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


Type: `array`

```yml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array
```

#### Patterns

The broker pattern determines the way in which messages are allocated and can be chosen from the following:

##### fan_out

With the fan out pattern all outputs will be sent every message that passes through Tyk Streams in parallel.

If an output applies back pressure it will block all subsequent messages, and if an output fails to send a message it will be retried continuously until completion or service shut down. This mechanism is in place in order to prevent one bad output from causing a larger retry loop that results in a good output from receiving unbounded message duplicates.

##### fan_out_fail_fast

The same as the `fan_out` pattern, except that output failures will not be automatically retried. This pattern should be used with caution as busy retry loops could result in unlimited duplicates being introduced into the non-failure outputs.

##### fan_out_sequential

Similar to the fan out pattern except outputs are written to sequentially, meaning an output is only written to once the preceding output has confirmed receipt of the same message.

If an output applies back pressure it will block all subsequent messages, and if an output fails to send a message it will be retried continuously until completion or service shut down. This mechanism is in place in order to prevent one bad output from causing a larger retry loop that results in a good output from receiving unbounded message duplicates.

##### fan_out_sequential_fail_fast

The same as the `fan_out_sequential` pattern, except that output failures will not be automatically retried. This pattern should be used with caution as busy retry loops could result in unlimited duplicates being introduced into the non-failure outputs.

##### round_robin

With the round robin pattern each message will be assigned a single output following their order. If an output applies back pressure it will block all subsequent messages. If an output fails to send a message then the message will be re-attempted with the next input, and so on.

##### greedy

The greedy pattern results in higher output throughput at the cost of potentially disproportionate message allocations to those outputs. Each message is sent to a single output, which is determined by allowing outputs to claim messages as soon as they are able to process them. This results in certain faster outputs potentially processing more messages at the cost of slower outputs.


### HTTP Client

Sends messages to an HTTP server.

#### Common

```yml
# Common config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  http_client:
    url: "" # No default (required)
    verb: POST
    headers: {}
    timeout: 5s
    max_in_flight: 64
    batching:
      count: 0
      byte_size: 0
      period: ""
      check: ""
```

#### Advanced

```yml
# All config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  http_client:
    url: "" # No default (required)
    verb: POST
    headers: {}
    metadata:
      include_prefixes: []
      include_patterns: []
    dump_request_log_level: ""
    oauth:
      enabled: false
      consumer_key: ""
      consumer_secret: ""
      access_token: ""
      access_token_secret: ""
    oauth2:
      enabled: false
      client_key: ""
      client_secret: ""
      token_url: ""
      scopes: []
      endpoint_params: {}
    basic_auth:
      enabled: false
      username: ""
      password: ""
    jwt:
      enabled: false
      private_key_file: ""
      signing_method: ""
      claims: {}
      headers: {}
    tls:
      enabled: false
      skip_cert_verify: false
      enable_renegotiation: false
      root_cas: ""
      root_cas_file: ""
      client_certs: []
    extract_headers:
      include_prefixes: []
      include_patterns: []
    timeout: 5s
    retry_period: 1s
    max_retry_backoff: 300s
    retries: 3
    backoff_on:
      - 429
    drop_on: []
    successful_on: []
    proxy_url: "" # No default (optional)
    batch_as_multipart: false
    propagate_response: false
    max_in_flight: 64
    batching:
      count: 0
      byte_size: 0
      period: ""
      check: ""
      processors: [] # No default (optional)
    multipart: []
```

When the number of retries expires the output will reject the message, the behavior after this will depend on the pipeline but usually this simply means the send is attempted again until successful whilst applying back pressure.

<!-- TODO: when interpolation supported
The URL and header values of this type can be dynamically set using function interpolations.
-->

The body of the HTTP request is the raw contents of the message payload. If the message has multiple parts (is a batch) the request will be sent according to [RFC1341](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html). This behavior can be disabled by setting the field [batch_as_multipart](#batch_as_multipart) to `false`.

##### Propagating Responses

It's possible to propagate the response from each HTTP request back to the input source by setting `propagate_response` to `true`. Only inputs that support synchronous responses are able to make use of these propagated responses.

#### Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a [batch]({{< ref "api-management/stream-config#batching-6" >}}) for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level.

### HTTP Server

Sets up an HTTP server that will send messages over HTTP(S) GET requests. HTTP 2.0 is supported when using TLS, which is enabled when key and cert files are specified.

#### Common

```yml
# Common config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  http_server:
    address: ""
    path: /get
    stream_path: /get/stream
    ws_path: /get/ws
    allowed_verbs:
      - GET
```

#### Advanced

```yml
# All config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  http_server:
    address: ""
    path: /get
    stream_path: /get/stream
    ws_path: /get/ws
    allowed_verbs:
      - GET
    timeout: 5s
    cert_file: ""
    key_file: ""
    cors:
      enabled: false
      allowed_origins: []
```

Sets up an HTTP server that will send messages over HTTP(S) GET requests.

<!-- TODO add link here  If the `address` config field is left blank the [service-wide HTTP server](/docs/components/http/about) will be used. -->

Three endpoints will be registered at the paths specified by the fields `path`, `stream_path` and `ws_path`. Which allow you to consume a single message batch, a continuous stream of line delimited messages, or a websocket of messages for each request respectively.

When messages are batched the `path` endpoint encodes the batch according to [RFC1341](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html).

<!-- TODO add link here - This behavior can be overridden by [archiving your batches](/docs/configuration/batching#post-batch-processing). -->

Please note, messages are considered delivered as soon as the data is written to the client. There is no concept of at least once delivery on this output.

Please note that components within a Tyk config will register their respective endpoints in a non-deterministic order. This means that establishing precedence of endpoints that are registered via multiple `http_server` inputs or outputs (either within brokers or from cohabiting streams) is not possible in a predictable way.

This ambiguity makes it difficult to ensure that paths which are both a subset of a path registered by a separate component, and end in a slash (`/`) and will therefore match against all extensions of that path, do not prevent the more specific path from matching against requests.

It is therefore recommended that you ensure paths of separate components do not collide unless they are explicitly non-competing.

For example, if you were to deploy two separate `http_server` inputs, one with a path `/foo/` and the other with a path `/foo/bar`, it would not be possible to ensure that the path `/foo/` does not swallow requests made to `/foo/bar`.

The config field `ack_replicas` determines whether we wait for acknowledgment from all replicas or just a single broker.

<!-- Add links to bloblang queries : Both the `key` and `topic` fields can be dynamically set using function interpolations described [here](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries). -->

Metadata will be added to each message sent as headers (version 0.11+), but can be restricted using the field [metadata](#metadata).

##### Strict Ordering and Retries

When strict ordering is required for messages written to topic partitions it is important to ensure that both the field `max_in_flight` is set to `1` and that the field `retry_as_batch` is set to `true`.

You must also ensure that failed batches are never rerouted back to the same output. This can be done by setting the field `max_retries` to `0` and `backoff.max_elapsed_time` to empty, which will apply back pressure indefinitely until the batch is sent successfully.

<!-- TODO: Add link to fallback broker -->
However, this also means that manual intervention will eventually be required in cases where the batch cannot be sent due to configuration problems such as an incorrect `max_msg_bytes` estimate. A less strict but automated alternative would be to route failed batches to a dead letter queue using a `fallback` broker, but this would allow subsequent batches to be delivered in the meantime whilst those failed batches are dealt with.

##### Troubleshooting

- I'm seeing logs that report `Failed to connect to kafka: kafka: client has run out of available brokers to talk to (Is your cluster reachable?)`, but the brokers are definitely reachable.

Unfortunately this error message will appear for a wide range of connection problems even when the broker endpoint can be reached. Double check your authentication configuration and also ensure that you have [enabled TLS](#tlsenabled) if applicable.

#### Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a [batch]({{< ref "api-management/stream-config#batching-6" >}}) for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level.

## Processors

### Overview

Tyk Streams processors are functions applied to messages passing through a pipeline.

Processors are set via config, and depending on where in the config they are placed they will be run either immediately after a specific input (set in the input section), on all messages (set in the pipeline section) or before a specific output (set in the output section). Most processors apply to all messages and can be placed in the pipeline section:

```yaml
pipeline:
  threads: 1
  processors:
    - label: my_avro
      avro:
        operator: "to_json"
        encoding: textual
```

The `threads` field in the pipeline section determines how many parallel processing threads are created. You can read more about parallel processing in the [pipeline guide]({{< ref "api-management/stream-config#processing-pipelines" >}}).

#### Labels

<!--

TODO: Replace paragraph below in subsequent iteration when know if metrics supported from product

Processors have an optional field `label` that can uniquely identify them in observability data such as metrics and logs. This can be useful when running configs with multiple nested processors, otherwise their metrics labels will be generated based on their composition. For more information check out the [metrics documentation].

-->

Processors have an optional field `label` that can uniquely identify them in observability data such as logs.

### Avro

```yml
# Config fields, with default values
label: ""
avro:
  operator: "" # No default (required)
  encoding: textual
  schema: ""
  schema_path: ""
```

{{< warning success >}}
**Note**

If you are consuming or generating messages using a schema registry service then it is likely this processor will fail as those services require messages to be prefixed with the identifier of the schema version being used.

{{< /warning >}}

#### Operators

##### to_json

Converts Avro documents into a JSON structure. This makes it easier to
manipulate the contents of the document within Tyk Streams. The encoding field
specifies how the source documents are encoded.


##### from_json

Attempts to convert JSON documents into Avro documents according to the
specified encoding.

#### Fields

##### operator

The [operator](#operators) to execute


Type: `string`
Options: `to_json`, `from_json`.

##### encoding

An Avro encoding format to use for conversions to and from a schema.


Type: `string`
Default: `"textual"`
Options: `textual`, `binary`, `single`.

##### schema

A full Avro schema to use.


Type: `string`
Default: `""`

##### schema_path

The path of a schema document to apply. Use either this or the `schema` field.


Type: `string`
Default: `""`

```yml
# Examples

schema_path: file://path/to/spec.avsc

schema_path: http://localhost:8081/path/to/spec/versions/1
```

## Tracers

### Overview

A tracer type represents a destination for Tyk Streams to send tracing events to such as [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/).

When a tracer is configured all messages will be allocated a root span during ingestion that represents their journey through a Streams pipeline. Many Streams processors create spans, and so tracing is a great way to analyse the pathways of individual messages as they progress through a Streams instance.

Some inputs, such as `http_server` and `http_client`, are capable of extracting a root span from the source of the message (HTTP headers). This is
a work in progress and should eventually expand so that all inputs have a way of doing so.

Other inputs, such as `kafka` can be configured to extract a root span by using the `extract_tracing_map` field.

A tracer config section looks like this:

```yaml
tracer:
  jaeger:
    agent_address: localhost:6831
    sampler_type: const
    sampler_param: 1
```

{{< warning success >}}
**Note**

Although the configuration spec of this component is stable the format of spans, tags and logs created by Streams is subject to change as it is tuned for improvement.

## Metrics

### Overview

Streams emits lots of metrics in order to expose how components configured within your pipeline are behaving. You can configure exactly where these metrics end up with the config field `metrics`, which describes a metrics format and destination. For example, if you wished to push them via the Prometheus protocol you could use this configuration:

```yaml
metrics:
  prometheus:
    push_interval: 1s
    push_job_name: in
    push_url: http://localhost:9091
```

### Metric Names

## Common Configuration

### Batching

Tyk Streams is able to join sources and sinks with sometimes conflicting batching behaviours without sacrificing its strong delivery guarantees. Therefore, batching within Tyk Streams is a mechanism that serves multiple purposes:

1. [Performance (throughput)](#performance)
2. [Compatibility (mixing multi and single part message protocols)](#compatibility)

#### Performance

For most users the only benefit of batching messages is improving throughput over your output protocol. For some protocols this can happen in the background and requires no configuration from you. However, if an output has a `batching` configuration block this means it benefits from batching and requires you to specify how you'd like your batches to be formed by configuring a [batching policy](#batch-policy):

```yaml
output:
  kafka:
    addresses: [ todo:9092 ]
    topic: tyk_stream

    # Either send batches when they reach 10 messages or when 100ms has passed
    # since the last batch.
    batching:
      count: 10
      period: 100ms
```

However, a small number of inputs such as [kafka]({{< ref "api-management/stream-config#kafka" >}}) must be consumed sequentially (in this case by partition) and therefore benefit from specifying your batch policy at the input level instead:

```yaml
input:
  kafka:
    addresses: [ todo:9092 ]
    topics: [ tyk_input_stream ]
    batching:
      count: 10
      period: 100ms

output:
  kafka:
    addresses: [ todo:9092 ]
    topic: tyk_stream
```

Inputs that behave this way are documented as such and have a `batching` configuration block.

Sometimes you may prefer to create your batches before processing, in which case if your input doesn't already support [a batch policy](#batch-policy) you can instead use a [broker]({{< ref "api-management/stream-config#broker" >}}), which also allows you to combine inputs with a single batch policy:

```yaml
input:
  broker:
    inputs:
      - resource: foo
      - resource: bar
    batching:
      count: 50
      period: 500ms
```

This also works the same with [output brokers]({{< ref "api-management/stream-config#broker-1" >}}).

#### Compatibility

Tyk Streams is able to read and write over protocols that support multiple part messages, and all payloads travelling through Tyk Streams are represented as a multiple part message. Therefore, all components within Tyk Streams are able to work with multiple parts in a message as standard.

When messages reach an output that *doesn't* support multiple parts the message is broken down into an individual message per part, and then one of two behaviours happen depending on the output. If the output supports batch sending messages then the collection of messages are sent as a single batch. Otherwise, Tyk Streams falls back to sending the messages sequentially in multiple, individual requests.

This behaviour means that not only can multiple part message protocols be easily matched with single part protocols, but also the concept of multiple part messages and message batches are interchangeable within Tyk Streams.

#### Batch Policy

When an input or output component has a config field `batching` that means it supports a batch policy. This is a mechanism that allows you to configure exactly how your batching should work on messages before they are routed to the input or output it's associated with. Batches are considered complete and will be flushed downstream when either of the following conditions are met:


- The `byte_size` field is non-zero and the total size of the batch in bytes matches or exceeds it (disregarding metadata.)
- The `count` field is non-zero and the total number of messages in the batch matches or exceeds it.
- The `period` field is non-empty and the time since the last batch exceeds its value.

This allows you to combine conditions:

```yaml
output:
  kafka:
    addresses: [ todo:9092 ]
    topic: tyk_stream

    # Either send batches when they reach 10 messages or when 100ms has passed
    # since the last batch.
    batching:
      count: 10
      period: 100ms
```

{{< note >}}
**Note**
A batch policy has the capability to *create* batches, but not to break them down.

{{</ note>}}

If your configured pipeline is processing messages that are batched *before* they reach the batch policy then they may circumvent the conditions you've specified here, resulting in sizes you aren't expecting.

### Field Paths

Many components within Tyk Streams allow you to target certain fields using a JSON dot path. The syntax of a path within Tyk Streams is similar to [JSON Pointers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901), except with dot separators instead of slashes (and no leading dot.) When a path is used to set a value any path segment that does not yet exist in the structure is created as an object.

For example, if we had the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "foo": {
    "bar": 21
  }
}
```

The query path `foo.bar` would return `21`.

The characters `~` (%x7E) and `.` (%x2E) have special meaning in Tyk Streams paths. Therefore `~` needs to be encoded as `~0` and `.` needs to be encoded as `~1` when these characters appear within a key.

For example, if we had the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "foo.foo": {
    "bar~bo": {
      "": {
        "baz": 22
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The query path `foo~1foo.bar~0bo..baz` would return `22`.

#### Arrays

When Tyk Streams encounters an array whilst traversing a JSON structure it requires the next path segment to be either an integer of an existing index, or, depending on whether the path is used to query or set the target value, the character `*` or `-` respectively.

For example, if we had the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "foo": [
    0, 1, { "bar": 23 }
  ]
}
```

The query path `foo.2.bar` would return `23`.

##### Querying

When a query reaches an array the character `*` indicates that the query should return the value of the remaining path from each element of the array (within an array.)

##### Setting

When an array is reached the character `-` indicates that a new element should be appended to the end of the existing elements, if this character is not the final segment of the path then an object is created.

### Processing Pipelines

Within a Tyk Streams configuration, in between `input` and `output`, is a `pipeline` section. This section describes an array of processors that are to be applied to *all* messages, and are not bound to any particular input or output.

If you have processors that are heavy on CPU and aren't specific to a certain input or output they are best suited for the pipeline section. It is advantageous to use the pipeline section as it allows you to set an explicit number of parallel threads of execution:

```yaml
input:
  resource: foo

pipeline:
  threads: 4
  processors:
    - avro:
        operator: "to_json"

output:
  resource: bar
```

If the field `threads` is set to `-1` (the default) it will automatically match the number of logical CPUs available. By default almost all Tyk Streams sources will utilize as many processing threads as have been configured, which makes horizontal scaling easy.
