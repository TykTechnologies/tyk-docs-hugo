## Introduction
In API management, authentication and authorization are responsible for controlling access to your APIs and protecting sensitive data. Each serves a distinct purpose:

* **Authentication**: Confirms the identity of the user or system making the API request. This step validates "who" is attempting to access the API, commonly through methods like tokens, passwords, or certificates.

* **Authorization**: Determines if the authenticated user or system has the right permissions to perform the requested action. This step defines "what" they are allowed to do based on assigned roles, scopes, or policies.

Together, these processes allow API providers to control access, safeguard data integrity, and meet security and compliance standards, making them vital for any API management strategy.

## Set Up OAuth 2.0 Authorization

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol that enables applications to request limited access to resources on behalf of a user, without needing the user’s password. This approach is common for allowing apps to share data across platforms securely—for example, letting a calendar app access your contacts so you can share schedules between coworkers and friends- making it easier to find an open slot in your day.

In API management, OAuth 2.0 offers flexible ways to handle access requests depending on the scenario, such as user login or server-to-server interactions. This section will guide you through setting up OAuth 2.0 with Tyk, either by integrating it with your current setup or by using Tyk as the OAuth provider to simplify token management.

To implement OAuth 2.0 in Tyk, you have two main options:

### Integrating OAuth 2.0
#### Option 1: Integrate Existing OAuth 2.0 Flow

1. **Manage Tokens Within Your Application:** Utilize your existing OAuth 2.0 implementation or a preferred library to generate and manage tokens.
2. **Create Sessions in Tyk:** Once your API issues a token, create corresponding key sessions within Tyk using the Gateway REST API.
3. **Configure API Access in Tyk:**
    * Set "Auth Token" as your API's authentication mode within Tyk.
    * Configure the "Authorization" header.
    * Consider adding OAuth-specific endpoints (`/access`, `/authorize`) to your API's `ignored_paths` list for direct access if required.

#### Option 2: Using Tyk as The OAuth 2.0 Provider

1. **Simplify Authorization with Tyk:** Designate Tyk as your OAuth 2.0 provider, streamlining token generation and management.
2. **Seamless Application Integration:** Integrate your application with Tyk's API and notification endpoints for streamlined OAuth 2.0 functionality.


{{< youtube-seo id="C4CUDTIHynk" title="Using OAuth2.0 To Authenticate Your APIs">}}


### Understanding the OAuth 2.0 Flow within Tyk

1. **Register a Client ID in Tyk**: 
   - Start by registering a new OAuth client on the Tyk dashboard. This generates a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your app, which you’ll use for secure access requests.

2. **Request Authorization for the Client**: 
   - Your app directs the user to Tyk’s authorization URL (`/oauth/authorize/`) with the Client ID, prompting Tyk to check that the request follows OAuth standards and that the Client ID is active and valid.

3. **Redirect to User Login and Authorization**:
   - If the authorization request is valid, Tyk redirects the user to your app’s **Login and Authorization page**. Here, the user logs in, approves access, and grants permissions to the app, similar to a standard OAuth consent flow.

4. **Authorize the Client in Tyk**:
   - After the user approves, your app calls Tyk’s Authorization API (`/authorize-client/`), sending the Client ID and user permissions. Tyk then generates an **Authorization Code** for your app.

5. **Redirect the User Back to Your App**:
   - Tyk redirects the user to your app’s specified **redirect URL**, including the newly generated authorization code.

6. **Exchange Authorization Code for an Access Token**:
   - Your app now exchanges the authorization code for an access token by calling Tyk’s token endpoint (`/oauth/token`). This token lets the app access the user’s data per the permissions granted.

7. **Optional: Receive Notifications via Webhook**:
   - If needed, set up a webhook endpoint in your app to receive notifications from Tyk whenever a new access token is issued. This helps your app keep track of the user’s access status in real time.

This seems like a complicated process and very verbose - however in actuality, the integration piece is very small. As an API owner, the only steps that require active integration are:

- **Step 1**: Registering a Client ID (done in Tyk dashboard)
- **Step 3**: Creating a login and authorization page for users to approve app access
- **Step 7**: Setting up a webhook to track access tokens (optional)


#### Enabling OAuth 2.0 via the Dashboard

1. **Select OAuth 2.0 for Your API**: On the Tyk Dashboard, Navigate to APIs, select the API you want to affect and select "edit". Enable 

   {{< img src="/img/dashboard/system-management/oauth-auth-mode-new.png" alt="Set Authentication Mode" >}}

2. **Configure Grant Type Settings**: Define allowed access and authorize types aligned with your chosen OAuth 2.0 grant type (e.g., Authorization Code).
3. **Set Redirection URLs**: For grant types involving redirects, provide the OAuth login redirect URL and the OAuth notification URL.
4. **Create an Access Policy**: Establish a policy that explicitly grants access to this API.
5. **Register a New OAuth Client**: Go to the "OAuth Clients" section for your API and add a new client.
     * Specify a valid redirect URI.
     * Associate the client with the access policy you created.

     {{< img src="/img/api-management/security/create-oauth-from-api-list.png" alt="OAuth Clients" >}}
     {{< img src="/img/api-management/security/fill-out-client-details-oauth.png" alt="Add New OAuth Client" >}}

6. **Access Client Credentials**: After client creation, view the generated Client ID and Secret.

    {{< img src="/img/api-management/security/client-secret-oauth.png" alt="View Client ID and Secret" >}}

#### Enabling OAuth 2.0 via an API Definition

For programmatic control, configure OAuth 2.0 directly within your API's JSON definition:

```yaml
{
  "name": "OAuth Test API",
  // ... other API settings
  "use_oauth2": true,
  "oauth_meta": {
    "allowed_access_types": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
    "allowed_authorize_types": ["code", "token"],
    "auth_login_redirect": "http://yourapp.com/login"
  },
  "notifications": {
    "shared_secret": "your-shared-secret",
    "oauth_on_keychange_url": "http://yourapp.com/oauth_notifications"
  }
  // ... other API settings
}
```

- **`name`**: Specifies the name of the API, in this case, "OAuth Test API."
- **`use_oauth2`**: Enables OAuth 2.0 authentication for this API (`true` indicates OAuth 2.0 is used).
- **`oauth_meta`**: Contains OAuth 2.0-specific configuration options:
  - **`allowed_access_types`**: Defines which OAuth 2.0 access types are allowed, such as `authorization_code` and `refresh_token`.
  - **`allowed_authorize_types`**: Defines which OAuth 2.0 authorization methods are permitted, like `code` (authorization code) and `token` (implicit flow).
  - **`auth_login_redirect`**: Specifies the URL to which users are redirected after successful login, typically the login page of your application.
- **`notifications`**: Manages notifications for OAuth events:
  - **`shared_secret`**: A secret key shared between Tyk and your app, used to secure notifications.
  - **`oauth_on_keychange_url`**: The URL to which Tyk sends a notification when an OAuth key changes (e.g., token revocation or regeneration).



### Manage Quotas and Limits

Utilize Tyk's `/tyk/oauth/authorize-client/` endpoint with the `key_rules` parameter to define key rules for tokens generated during the OAuth flow. These rules encompass rate limits, quotas, expiry times, and access rights:

```yaml
{
  "allowance": 1000,
  "rate": 1000,
  "per": 60,
  "expires": -1,
  "quota_max": -1,
  "quota_renews": 1406121006,
  "quota_remaining": 0,
  "quota_renewal_rate": 60,
  "access_rights": {
    "APIID1": {
      "api_name": "HMAC API",
      "api_id": "APIID1",
      "versions": [
        "Default"
      ]
    }
  },
  "org_id": "1",
  "oauth_client_id": "client-id-here",
  "hmac_enabled": false,
  "hmac_string": ""
}
```
{{< note success >}}
**Note**  
Instead of passing a `key_rules` parameter when authorizing a client, Tyk can now have an API policy that manages access rules bound to the Client ID doing the accessing, if a bound policy ID is used when generating the OAuth client, when a token is generated for the client then Tyk will generate a token based on the policy data. This is especially useful in generative contexts such as the `client_credentials` grant.
{{< /note >}}

### Configure Notifications

To receive notifications about token changes (e.g., new tokens, refresh tokens) configure the `notifications` section in your API definition:

* `oauth_on_keychange_url`: Set the URL where Tyk will send notifications.
* `shared_secret`:  Use this secret for secure communication between Tyk and your application; the secret is sent as a header (`X-Tyk-Shared-Secret`) with every notification.

Example notification:

```yaml
{
  "auth_code": "",
  "new_oauth_token": "",
  "refresh_token": "",
  "old_refresh_token": "",
  "notification_type": ""
}
```

{{< note success >}}
**Note**

* **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Manage access using Tyk's built-in access controls, including versioning and named API IDs, going beyond Client ID-based control.
* **Usage Analytics:** Leverage Tyk's analytics capabilities to monitor OAuth 2.0 usage effectively, grouping data by Client ID.
* **Multi-API Access**: Enable access to multiple APIs using a single OAuth token. Configure one API for OAuth 2.0 token issuance and the other APIs with the "Auth Token" method, linking them through a common policy.
{{< /note >}}


### Supported Grant Types

Tyk offers extensive support for various OAuth 2.0 grant types, catering to diverse use cases:

* Authorization Code
* Refresh Token
* Username and Password
* Client Credentials
* Authorization Token Flow (Ideal for server-side web applications)


#### Use Authorization Code Grant

The Authorization Code Grant Type is a widely used OAuth 2.0 flow for web applications. It allows client applications to access user resources securely.

This process requires three steps:

* Redirect to a login page
* Request an authorization code
* Exchange the code for a token

The below image shows the request/response interactions between Client, Gateway, identity server, and notification server.

{{< img src="/img/diagrams/diagram_docs_authorization-code-grant-type@2x.png" alt="Authorization grant type flow" >}}

##### Redirect the User to a Login Page

First, the client application must redirect the user to the authorization server's login page. This is where the user will authenticate and authorize the client.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://tyk.cloud.tyk.io/oauth-api/oauth/authorize/ \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'response_type=code&client_id=ed59158fa2344e94b3e6278e8ab85142&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fclient-redirect-uri'
```

**Request:**

| Parameter       | Value                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Method**      | `POST`                                                                                                                                     |
| **URL**         | Uses the special OAuth endpoint `/oauth/authorize` appended to the API URI, e.g., `https://<your-gateway-host>/<your-api-listen-path>/oauth/authorize`. |
| **Content-Type** | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`                                                                                                    |

**Data:**

| Parameter       | Value                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `response_type` | `code`                                                                                 |
| `client_id`     | The OAuth client ID, e.g., `ed59158fa2344e94b3e6278e8ab85142`.                         |
| `redirect_uri`  | The OAuth client redirect URI, e.g., `http://example.com/client-redirect-uri`, URL encoded as `http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fclient-redirect-uri`. |

**Response:**

This request generates a `307 Temporary Redirect` to the OAuth client redirect URI. The user is redirected to authenticate and authorize the client, and the data forwarded will be used to request an authorization code.

##### Request an Authorization Code

After the user authorizes the request, the authorization server provides an authorization code. The client application needs to request this code from the authorization server.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://admin.cloud.tyk.io/api/apis/oauth/25b854d3fdc84703679f49ea33981aa9/authorize-client/ \
  -H 'Authorization: 70c3d834d46a4d6076e1585b0ef2e93e' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'response_type=code&client_id=ed59158fa2344e94b3e6278e8ab85142&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fclient-redirect-uri'
```

**Request:**

| Parameter       | Value                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Method**      | `POST`                                                                                                 |
| **URL**         | Uses the Dashboard API client authorization endpoint `/authorize-client/`.                               |
| **Authorization** | The Dashboard user credentials, e.g., `70c3d834d46a4d6076e1585b0ef2e93e`.                         |
| **Content-Type** | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`                                                                     |

**Data:**

| Parameter       | Value                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `response_type` | `code`                                                                                 |
| `client_id`     | The OAuth client ID, e.g., `ed59158fa2344e94b3e6278e8ab85142`.                         |
| `redirect_uri`  | The OAuth client redirect URI, e.g., `http://example.com/client-redirect-uri`, URL encoded as `http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fclient-redirect-uri`. |

**Response:**

The response provides the authorization code as `code` and the redirect URL as `redirect_to`. The client application will use this information to obtain an access token.

```yaml
{
  "code": "EaG1MK7LS8GbbwCAUwDo6Q",
  "redirect_to": "http://example.com/client-redirect-uri?code=EaG1MK7LS8GbbwCAUwDo6Q"
}
```

##### Exchange the Authorization Code for an Access Token

Once the client application has the authorization code, it can exchange this code for an access token, which is used to access the API.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://tyk.cloud.tyk.io/oauth-api/oauth/token/ \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic ZWQ1OTE1OGZhMjM0NGU5NGIzZTYyNzhlOGFiODUxNDI6TUdRM056RTJNR1F0WVRVeVpDMDBaVFZsTFdKak1USXRNakUyTVRNMU1tRTNOMk0x' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=ed59158fa2344e94b3e6278e8ab85142&code=EaG1MK7LS8GbbwCAUwDo6Q&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fclient-redirect-uri'
```

**Request:**

| Parameter       | Value                                                                                                                                                 |

| `redirect_uri`  | The OAuth client redirect URI, e.g., `http://example.com/client-redirect-uri`, URL encoded as `http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fclient-redirect-uri`.            |

**Response:**

The response provides the token as `access_token` in the returned JSON, which can then be used to access the API:

```yaml
{
  "access_token": "580defdbe1d21e0001c67e5c2a0a6c98ba8b4a059dc5825388501573",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "NWQzNGVhMTItMDE4Ny00MDFkLTljOWItNGE4NzI1ZGI1NGU2",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

**Notification:**

This grant will generate a notification sent from the Gateway to the OAuth Notifications URL, containing the OAuth Notifications Shared Secret as a header for verification purposes.

```yaml
{
  "auth_code": "EaG1MK7LS8GbbwCAUwDo6Q",
  "new_oauth_token": "580defdbe1d21e0001c67e5c2a0a6c98ba8b4a059dc5825388501573",
  "refresh_token": "NWQzNGVhMTItMDE4Ny00MDFkLTljOWItNGE4NzI1ZGI1NGU2",
  "old_refresh_token": "",
  "notification_type": "new"
}
```

#### Use Refresh Token Grant

The Refresh Token Grant Type is used to obtain a new access token when the current access token has expired or is about to expire. This allows clients to maintain a valid access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

This process involves two steps:
* Obtain a Refresh Token during the initial authorization.
* Use the Refresh Token to request a new Access Token.

{{< img src="/img/diagrams/diagram_docs_refresh-token-grant-type@2x.png" alt="Refresh Token grant type flow" >}}

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

Refresh tokens are single use only so cannot be reused, and when they are used they also invalidate the token they are associated with.

#### Use Client Credentials Grant

The Client Credentials Grant Type is used when the client application needs to access resources on behalf of itself rather than on behalf of a user. This flow is ideal for server-to-server interactions.

The process is only a single step:

* Request an Access Token

##### Response

Response provides the token as `access_token` in the returned JSON which can then be used to access the API:

```json
{
  "access_token": "580defdbe1d21e0001c67e5c40e93eac3d23494697470b90d7c81593",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```
{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

It does not provide a refresh token.
{{< /note >}}



#### Use Bearer Tokens
##### What is a bearer token ?

> Any party in possession of a bearer token (a "bearer") can use it to get access to the associated resources (without demonstrating possession of a cryptographic key). To prevent misuse, bearer tokens need to be protected from disclosure in storage and in transport.

Tyk provides bearer token access as one of the most convenient building blocks for managing security to your API. In a Tyk setup, this is called "Access Tokens" and is the default mode of any API Definition created for Tyk.

Bearer tokens are added to a request as a header or as a query parameter. If added as a header, they may be preceded by the word "Bearer" to indicate their type, though this is optional.

Traditionally these tokens are used as part of the `Authorization` header.

##### Enable bearer tokens in your API Definition with the Dashboard

To enable the use of a bearer token in your API:

1. Select your API from the **System Management > APIs** menu
2. Scroll to the **Authentication** options
3. Select **Authentication Token** from the drop-down list
4. Select **Strip Authorization Data** to strip any authorization data from your API requests
5. Tyk will by default assume you are using the `Authorization` header, but you can change this by setting the **Auth Key Header** name value
6. You can select whether to use a URL query string parameter as well as a header, and what parameter to use. If this is left blank, it will use the **Auth Key Header** name value.
7. You can select whether to use a **cookie value**. If this is left blank, it will use the Header name value.
8. You can select to use a **client certificate**. This allows you to create dynamic keys based on certificates.

{{< img src="/img/api-management/security/client-mtls-api-setup.png" alt="Target Details: Auth Token" >}}

##### Enable bearer tokens in your API Definition with file-based

Tyk will by default use the bearer token method to protect your API unless it is told otherwise.

These tokens can be set as a *header, url parameter, or cookie name of a request*. A request for a resource at the API endpoint of `/api/widgets/12345` that uses access tokens will require the addition of a header field, traditionally this is the `Authorization` header.

The name of the key can be defined as part of the API definition under the `auth` section of an API Definition file:

```{.copyWrapper}
"auth": {
  "auth_header_name": "authorization",
  "use_param": false,
  "param_name": "",
  "use_cookie": false,
  "cookie_name": ""
},
```

To use URL query parameters instead of a header, set the `auth.use_param` setting in your API definition to `true`. 

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

Unlike headers, URL query parameters are *case sensitive*.
{{< /note >}}


To use a cookie name instead of a header or request parameter, set the `use_cookie` parameter to `true`. Cookie names are also case sensitive.

**Signature validation**

If you are migrating from platforms like Mashery, which use request signing, you can enable signature validation like this:

```{.copyWrapper}
...
"auth": {
  "validate_signature": true,
  "signature": {
    "algorithm": "MasherySHA256",
    "header": "X-Signature",
    "secret": "secret",
    "allowed_clock_skew": 2
  }
}
...
```
`validate_signature`: boolean value to tell Tyk whether to enable signature validation or not

`signature.algorithm`: the algorithm you wish to validate the signature against. Currently supported
 - `MasherySHA256`
 - `MasheryMD5`
 
 `signature.header`: header key of attempted signature
 
 `signature.secret`: the shared secret which was used to sign the request
 - Can hold a dynamic value, by referencing `$tyk_meta` or `$tyk_context` variables.
 - Example: `"secret": "$tyk_meta.individual_secret"`. Which effectively means that you have created/imported the api key into Tyk, and have stored the shared secret in the field `individual_secret` of the session token's meta-data.

`signature.allowed_clock_skew`: allowed deviation in seconds between UNIX timestamp of Tyk & UNIX timestamp used to generate the signed request

**Custom tokens**

It is possible to provide Tyk with your own custom tokens, this can be achieved using the Tyk Gateway REST API. This is very useful if you have your own identity provider and don't want Tyk to create and manage tokens for you, and instead just mirror those tokens within Tyk to off-load access control, quotas and rate limiting from your own application.

##### Enabling bearer tokens with Tyk Operator

Please consult the Tyk Operator supporting documentation for an example of how to [enable a bearer token]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-operator/advanced-configurations/client-authentication#auth-token-bearer-token" >}}) with Tyk Operator.

### Revoke OAuth Tokens

This feature gives you (both developers and Dashboard users) the ability to revoke OAuth tokens. You can revoke specific tokens by providing the token and token hint (`access_token` or `refresh_token`) or you can revoke all OAuth Client tokens. 

You can revoke OAuth tokens via the following methods:
* From a Gateway API endpoint (in compliance with https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009). See the OAuth section of our [Swagger doc]({{< ref "tyk-gateway-api" >}}) for the Gateway REST API for details.
* Via a Dashboard API calls - [Revoke a token]({{< ref "tyk-apis/tyk-dashboard-api/oauth-key-management#revoke-a-single-oauth-client-token" >}}) and [revoke all tokens]({{< ref "tyk-apis/tyk-dashboard-api/oauth-key-management#revoke-all-oauth-client-tokens" >}})
* Via a Portal Developer API call - [Revoke a token]({{< ref "tyk-apis/tyk-portal-api/portal-developers#revoke-a-single-oauth-client-token" >}}) and [revoke all tokens]({{< ref "tyk-apis/tyk-portal-api/portal-developers#revoke-all-oauth-client-tokens" >}})
* Via the Developer menu from the Tyk Dashboard

Here's an example of how to revoke a token via the Tyk Dashboard API

#### Submit a Request to Revoke the Token

The client or server sends a request to the authorization server’s revocation endpoint to invalidate the token.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://auth-server.com/oauth2/revoke \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic ZWQ1OTE1OGZhMjM0NGU5NGIzZTYyNzhlOGFiODUxNDI6TUdRM056RTJNR1F0WVRVeVpDMDBaVFZsTFdKak1USXRNakUyTVRNMU1tRTNOMk0x' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'token=ACCESS_TOKEN&token_type_hint=access_token&client_id=CLIENT_ID&client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET'
```

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `token`           | The access token to revoke, e.g., `ACCESS_TOKEN`. |
| `token_type_hint` | The type of token being revoked, typically `access_token`. |
| `client_id`       | The OAuth client ID, e.g., `CLIENT_ID`.    |
| `client_secret`    | The client secret, e.g., `CLIENT_SECRET`.    |


## Other Authentication Methods

### Use Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication is a straightforward method where the user's credentials (username and password) are sent in an HTTP header encoded in Base64.

#### How does Basic Authentication work?

An API request made using Basic Authentication will have an `Authorization` header that contains the API key.

The value of the `Authorization` header will be in the form:

```
Basic base64Encode(username:password)
```

A real request could look something like:

```
GET /api/widgets/12345 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Authorization: Basic am9obkBzbWl0aC5jb206MTIzNDU2Nw==
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

In this example the username is `john@smith.com` and the password is `1234567` (see [base64encode.org](https://www.base64encode.org))

##### The problem with Basic Authentication

With Basic Authentication, the authentication credentials are transferred from client to server (in our case, the Tyk Gateway) as encoded plain text. This is not a particularly secure way to transfer the credentials as it is highly susceptible to intercept; as the security of user authentication is usually of critical importance to API owners, Tyk recommends that Basic Authentication should only ever be used in conjunction with a TLS such as SSL.

##### Protect your API with Basic Authentication

Authentication type is configured within your API Definition; this can be done via the [Tyk Dashboard](#enable-basic-authentication-using-the-tyk-dashboard) or directly within the [API Definition file](#enable-basic-authentication-in-your-file-based-api-definition).


#### Enable Basic Auth
##### Enable Basic Authentication using the Tyk Dashboard

1. Select your API from the **API Management > APIs** menu
2. Scroll to the **Authentication** options
3. Select **Basic Authentication** from the drop-down list
4. Select **Strip Authorization Data** to strip any authorization data from your API requests.
5. Tyk will by default assume you are using the `Authorization` header, but you can change this by setting the **Auth Key Header** name value
6. You can select whether to use a URL query string parameter as well as a header, and what parameter to use. If this is left blank, it will use the **Auth Key Header** name value.
7. You can select whether to use a **cookie value**. If this is left blank, it will use the Header name value.

{{< img src="/img/api-management/security/basic-auth-api-setup.png" alt="Target Details: Basic Auth" >}}

##### Enable Basic Authentication in your file-based API Definition 

To enable Basic Authentication, the API Definition file needs to be set up to allow basic authentication rather than expecting a standard access token; this is achieved  by setting `use_basic_auth` to true:

```{.copyWrapper}
{
  "name": "Tyk Test API",
  ...
  "use_basic_auth": true,
  ...
}
```

As you can see in the above example, enabling Basic Authentication is as simple as setting a flag for the feature in your API Definition object. Since Basic Authentication is a standard, Tyk will always look for the credentials as part of the `Authorization` header.

##### Enable basic authentication using Tyk Operator

Please consult the Tyk Operator supporting documentation for an example of how to [enable basic authentication]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-operator/advanced-configurations/client-authentication#basic-authentication" >}}) with Tyk Operator.

#### Create a Basic Authentication user

When using Basic Authentication, the API key used to access the API is not generated by the Tyk system, instead you need to create at least one Basic Authentication user in the Tyk Gateway. Tyk will compare the Basic Authentication key provided in the request against the list of users you have created.

##### Using Tyk Dashboard

You can use the Tyk Dashboard to register a Basic Authentication key that can then be used to access your API. 

When you select the API, you can see that Basic Authentication settings are automatically displayed in the Authentication tab:

{{< img src="/img/api-management/security/basic-auth-api-setup.png" alt="Basic Auth tab" >}}

Then add a username & password and save!

Now you can curl the API in two different ways:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/basicauth/get \
  --header "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'myusername:mypassword' | base64)"
<200 response>

$ curl http://myusername:mypassword@localhost:8080/basicauth/get
<200 response from upstream>
```
We have full tutorials to guide you to [create an API Key]({{< ref "getting-started/create-api-key" >}}) via the Dashboard. 

##### Using the Tyk Gateway API

This command creates a new basic authentication user in the Tyk Gateway with the user name `testuser` and password `mickey-mouse` by sending a `POST` command to the `/tyk/keys/` endpoint of Tyk Gateway API:

```{.copyWrapper}
curl -X POST -H "x-tyk-authorization: 352d20fe67be67f6340b4c0605b044c3" \
 -s \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -X POST \
 -d '{
    "allowance": 1000,
    "rate": 1000,
    "per": 1,
    "expires": -1,
    "quota_max": -1,
    "org_id": "53ac07777cbb8c2d53000002",
    "quota_renews": 1449051461,
    "quota_remaining": -1,
    "quota_renewal_rate": 60,
    "access_rights": {
        "{API-ID}": {
            "api_id": "{API-ID}",
            "api_name": "{API-NAME}",
            "versions": ["Default"]
        }
    },
    "meta_data": {},
    "basic_auth_data": {
        "password": "mickey-mouse"
    }
 }' http://{your-tyk-gateway-host}:{port}/tyk/keys/testuser | python -mjson.tool
```

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

You use `POST` to create a new user and `PUT` to update an existing entry.

Be careful to ensure that the `org_id` is set correctly and consistently so that the Basic Authentication user is created in the correct organization.
{{< /note >}}

##### Using the Tyk Dashboard API

This command creates a new basic authentication user in the Tyk Gateway with the user name `testuser2` and password `minnie-mouse` by sending a `POST` command to the `/tyk/keys/` endpoint of Tyk Dashboard API:

```{.copyWrapper}
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: 907aed9f88514f175f1dccf8a921f741"
 -s
 -H "Content-Type: application/json"
 -X POST
 -d '{

**Note**  

You use `POST` to create a new user and `PUT` to update an existing entry.

Be careful to ensure that the `org_id` is set correctly and consistently so that the Basic Authentication user is created in the correct organization.
{{< /note >}}

#### Extract credentials from the request body

In some cases, for example when dealing with SOAP, user credentials can be passed within the request body. To handle this situation, you can configure basic auth plugin to extract username and password from the body, by providing regexps like this:

```{.copyWrapper}
"basic_auth": {
    "extract_from_body": true,
    "body_user_regexp": "<User>(.*)</User>",
    "body_password_regexp": "<Password>(.*)</Password>"
}
```

Note that the regexp should contain only one match group, which points to the actual value.


### Integrate External OAuth Middleware

Tyk offers two types of OAuth authentication flow; Tyk itself as the identity provider (IdP) and Tyk connecting to an external 3rd party IdP. ‘External OAuth’ is what we call this second mechanism. To call an API that is protected by OAuth, you need to have an access token from the third party IDP (it could be an opaque token or a JWT). 

For subsequent calls the access token is provided alongside the API call and needs to be validated. With JWT, Tyk can confirm the validity of the JWT with the secret provided in your config. The secret signs the JWT when created and confirms that none of its contents has changed. 

For this reason, information like the expiry date which are often set within the JWT cannot be changed after the JWT has been initially created and signed. This means you are not able to revoke a token before the expiry set in the JWT with the standard JWT flow. With OAuth you can use [OAuth introspection](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7662) to overcome this. With introspection, you can validate the access token via an introspection endpoint that validates the token. 

Let’s see how external OAuth middleware is configured.

#### OAS contract

```yaml
externalOAuthServer:
  enabled: true,
  providers: # only one item in the array for now (we're going to support just one IDP config in the first iteration)
  - jwt: #validate JWTs generated by 3rd party Oauth servers (like Okta)
      enabled: true
      signingMethod: HMAC/RSA/ECDSA # to verify signing method used in jwt
      source: key # secret to verify signature
      issuedAtValidationSkew: 0
      notBeforeValidationSkew: 0
      expiresAtValidationSkew: 0
      identityBaseField: # identity claimName
    introspection: # array for introspection details
      enabled: true/false
      clientID: # for introspection request
      clientSecret: # for introspection request, if empty will use oAuth.secret
      url: # token introspection endpoint
      cache: # Tyk will cache the introspection response when `cache.enabled` is set to `true`
        enabled: true/false,
        timeout: 0 # The duration (in seconds) for which Tyk will retain the introspection outcome in its cache. If the value is "0", it indicates that the introspection outcome will be stored in the cache until the token's expiration.
      identityBaseField: # identity claimName
```

#### Tyk Classic API definition contract

```yaml
"external_oauth": {
  "enabled": true,
  "providers": [
    {
      "jwt": {
        "enabled": false,
        "signing_method": rsa/ecdsa/hmac,
        "source": # jwk url/ base64 encoded static secret / base64 encoded jwk url
        "identity_base_field": # identity claim name
        "expires_at_validation_skew": # validation skew config for exp
        "not_before_validation_skew": # validation skew config for nbf
        "issued_at_validation_skew" : # validation skew config for iat
      },
      "introspection": {
        "enabled": true,
        "url": # introspection endpoint url
        "client_id": # client id used for introspection
        "client_secret": # client secret to be filled here (plain text for now, TODO: decide on a more secure mechanism)
        "identity_base_field": # identity claim name
        "cache": {
          "enabled": true,
          "timeout": # timeout in seconds
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
- `externalOAuthServer` set `enabled` to `true` to enable the middleware.
- `providers` is an array of multiple IDP configurations, with each IDP config being an element in the `providers` array. 
- You can use this config to use JWT self validation using `jwt` or use introspection via `instropection` in the `providers` section .

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

For now, you’ll be limiting `providers` to have only one element, ie one IDP configured.
{{< /note >}}

#### JWT

There could be cases when you don’t need to introspect a JWT access token from a third party IDP, and instead you can just validate the JWT. This is similar to existing JWT middleware, adding it in External OAuth middleware for semantic reasons.

- `enabled` - enables JWT validation.
- `signingMethod` - specifies the signing method used to sign the JWT.
- `source` - the secret source, it can be one of:
  - a base64 encoded static secret
  - a valid JWK url in plain text
  - a valid JWK url in base64 encoded format
- `issuedAtValidationSkew` , `notBeforeValidationSkew`, `expiresAtValidationSkew` can be used to [configure clock skew](#adjust-jwt-clock-skew-configuration) for json web token validation.
- `identityBaseField` - the identity key name for claims. If empty it will default to `sub`.

#### Example: Tyk OAS API definition with JWT validation enabled

```json
"securitySchemes": {
  "external_jwt": {
    "enabled": true,
    "header": {
      "enabled": true,
      "name": "Authorization"
    },
    "providers": [
      {
        "jwt": {
          "enabled": true,
          "signingMethod": "hmac",
          "source": "dHlrLTEyMw==",
          "identityBaseField": "sub"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Example: Tyk Classic API definition with JWT validation enabled

```json
"external_oauth": {
  "enabled": true,
  "providers": [
      {
          "jwt": {
              "enabled": true,
              "signing_method": "hmac",
              "source": "dHlrLTEyMw==",
              "issued_at_validation_skew": 0,
              "not_before_validation_skew": 0,
              "expires_at_validation_skew": 0,
              "identity_base_field": "sub"
          },
          "introspection": {
              "enabled": false,
              "url": "",
              "client_id": "",
              "client_secret": "",
              "identity_base_field": "",
              "cache": {
                  "enabled": false,
                  "timeout": 0
              }
          }
      }
  ]
}
```
#### Introspection

For cases where you need to introspect the OAuth access token, Tyk uses the information in the `provider.introspection` section of the contract. This makes a network call to the configured introspection endpoint with the provided `clientID` and `clientSecret` to introspect the access token.

- `enabled` - enables OAuth introspection
- `clientID` - clientID used for OAuth introspection, available from IDP
- `clientSecret` - secret used to authenticate introspection call, available from IDP
- `url` - endpoint URL to make the introspection call
- `identityBaseField` - the identity key name for claims. If empty it will default to `sub`.

##### Caching

Introspection via a third party IdP is a network call. Sometimes it may be inefficient to call the introspection endpoint every time an API is called. Caching is the solution for this situation. Tyk caches the introspection response when `enabled` is set to `true` inside the `cache` configuration of `introspection`. Then it retrieves the value from the cache until the `timeout` value finishes. However, there is a trade-off here. When the timeout is long, it may result in accessing the upstream with a revoked access token. When it is short, the cache is not used as much resulting in more network calls. 

The recommended way to handle this balance is to never set the `timeout` value beyond the expiration time of the token, which would have been returned in the `exp` parameter of the introspection response.

See the example introspection cache configuration:

```yaml
"introspection": {
  ...
  "cache": {
    "enabled": true,
    "timeout": 60 // in seconds
  }
}
```
##### Example: Tyk OAS API definition external OAuth introspection enabled

```json
"securitySchemes": {
  "keycloak_oauth": {
    "enabled": true,
    "header": {
      "enabled": true,
      "name": "Authorization"
    },
    "providers": [
      {
        "introspection": {
          "enabled": true,
          "url": "http://localhost:8080/realms/tyk/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect",
          "clientId": "introspection-client",
          "clientSecret": "DKyFN0WXu7IXWzR05QZOnnSnK8uAAZ3U",
          "identityBaseField": "sub",
          "cache": {
            "enabled": true,
            "timeout": 3
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
##### Example: Tyk Classic API definition with external OAuth introspection enabled

```json
"external_oauth": {
  "enabled": true,
  "providers": [
      {
          "jwt": {

              "identity_base_field": ""
          },

              }
          }
      }
  ]
}
```


### Authenticate Using Go Plugins

Go Plugin Authentication allows you to implement custom authentication logic using the Go programming language. This method is useful for scenarios where you need to implement specialized authentication mechanisms that are not natively supported by Tyk.
To learn more about using Tyk Golang Plugins, go [here](/plugins/supported-languages/golang/#authentication-with-a-golang-plugin)


### Sign Requests with HMAC

HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a mechanism that allows for verifying the integrity and authenticity of a message. It uses a shared secret key between the client and server to generate a unique hash for each request.

#### Generate and Include HMAC Signature in the Request

The client generates an HMAC signature using a shared secret and includes it in the request's `Authorization` header.

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://api.example.com/protected-resource \
  -H 'Authorization: HMAC <calculated-signature>'
```

**Request:**

| Parameter       | Value                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Method**      | `GET`                                               |
| **URL**         | The API endpoint for the protected resource.        |
| **Authorization** | HMAC signature, e.g., `HMAC <calculated-signature>`. |

#### Server Validates the HMAC Signature

The server regenerates the signature using the same secret and compares it with the one sent by the client. If they match, the request is considered authentic.

### Use OpenID Connect

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

Tyk's dedicated OpenID Connect Authentication middleware will be deprecated from Tyk 5.7.0. Tyk's [JSON Web Token (JWT)](#use-json-web-tokens-jwt) authentication method also allows you to integrate with an OIDC provider, so the dedicated OIDC middleware will be deprecated to reduce duplication and potential for misconfiguration.
{{< /note >}}


[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works) (OIDC) builds on top of OAuth 2.0, adding authentication. You can secure your APIs on Tyk by integrating with any standards compliant OIDC provider using [JSON Web Tokens](#use-json-web-tokens-jwt) (JWTs).
JWTs offer a simple way to use the third-party Identity Provider (IdP) without needing any direct integration between the Tyk and 3rd-party systems.

To integrate a 3rd party OAuth2/OIDC IdP with Tyk, all you will need to do is ensure that your IdP can issue OAuth2 JWT access tokens as opposed to opaque tokens.

The client application authenticates with the IdP which then provides an access token that is accepted by Tyk. Tyk will take care of the rest, ensuring that the rate limits and quotas of the underlying identity of the bearer are maintained across JWT token re-issues, so long as the "sub" (or whichever identity claim you chose to use) is available and consistent throughout and the policy that underpins the security clearance of the token exists too.



### Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. They are commonly used in API authentication and authorization.

#### Protecting an API with JWT

To protect an API with JWT, we need to execute the following steps:
* Set Authentication Mode
* Set the JWT Signing Method
* Set the Identity Source and Policy Field Name
* Set a Default Policy
* Generate a JWT


##### Set Authentication Mode

1. Select JSON Web Tokens as the Authentication mode
2. [Set the cryptographic signing method](#set-up-jwt-signing-method) to `HMAC (shared)` and the public secret as `tyk123`
3. Set the Identity Source and Policy Field Name

{{< img src="/img/api-management/security/jwt-hmac.png" alt="Target Details: JSON Web Token" >}}

##### Set a Default Policy

If Tyk cannot find a `pol` claim, it will apply this Default Policy. Select a policy that gives access to this API we are protecting, or [go create one first]({{< ref "getting-started/create-security-policy" >}}) if it doesn't exist.

Make sure to save the changes to the API Definition.

##### Generate a JWT

Let's generate a JWT so we can test our new protected API.

Head on over to [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/).  Sign the default JWT with our HMAC Shared Secret `tyk123` in the VERIFY SIGNATURE section.  Your screen should look similar to this:

{{< img src="/img/dashboard/system-management/jwt_jwtio_example.png" alt="Auth Configuration" >}}

Copy the Encoded JWT and let's make a cURL against the Tyk API Definition:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/my-jwt-api/get \
--header "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.7u0ls1snw4tPEzd0JTFaf19oXoOvQYtowiHEAZnan74"
```

#### Use the JWT

The client includes the JWT in the Authorization header when making requests to the API.

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://api.example.com/protected-resource \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...'
```

**Request:**

| Parameter       | Value                                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Method**      | `GET`                                                   |
| **URL**         | The API endpoint for the protected resource.           |
| **Authorization** | Bearer token, e.g., `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`. |

#### JWT and Auth0 with Tyk

This will walk you through securing your APIs with JWTs via Auth0. We also have the following video that will walk you through the process.

{{< youtube-seo id="jm4V7XzbrZw" title="Protect Your APIs with Auth0 JWT and Tyk">}}

##### Prerequisites

* A free account with Auth0
* A Tyk Self-Managed or Cloud installation

##### Create an Application in Auth0

1. Log in to your Auth0 account.
2. Select APIs from the Applications menu.

   {{< img src="/img/auth0/auth0-create-api.png" alt="Auth0 Create API" >}}

3. Click Create API and enter a name and identifier for your API.

   {{< img src="/img/auth0/api-details.png" alt="Auth0 API details" >}}

4. From the Test tab, follow the instructions on how to get an access token.

   {{< img src="img/auth0/auth0-test-curl.png" alt="Auth0 Test with cURL" >}}

5. From the cURL tab, copy the token request command.

   ```bash
   curl --request POST \
     --url https://dev-yjd8e8u5.us.auth0.com/oauth/token \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '{"client_id":{CLIENT_ID},"client_secret":{CLIENT_SECRET},"audience":{AUDIENCE},"grant_type":"client_credentials"}'
   ```

6. Paste the command in a terminal window to generate your token. Save this token locally.

   ```yaml
   {
     "access_token": "xxxxxxxxxxx",
     "token_type": "Bearer"
   }
   ```

7. After creating your API, a new Auth0 Application will be created. Go to the Applications section to view it.

   {{< img src="/img/auth0/new-application.png" alt="New Auth0 Application" >}}

8. Copy the Domain from the Basic Information. You will use this when adding an API to Tyk.

   {{< img src="/img/keycloak-jwt/navigate-to-admin-console.png" alt="Navigate to Keycloak Administration console" >}}

3. Create a Keycloak realm from the top left-hand side dropdown.

   {{< img src="/img/keycloak-jwt/create-jwt-realm.png" alt="Create Keycloak Realm" >}}

4. Create a Keycloak client.

   {{< img src="/img/keycloak-jwt/create-client.png" alt="Create Client" >}}

5. Enter the necessary client details.

   {{< img src="/img/keycloak-jwt/create-client-step-1.png" alt="Add client details" >}}

6. Enable client authentication and Service account roles under Authentication flow.

   {{< img src="/img/keycloak-jwt/create-client-step-2.png" alt="Update client permissions" >}}

7. Set the redirection URL rules.

   {{< img src="/img/keycloak-jwt/create-client-step-3.png" alt="Add redirection URL rules" >}}

8. Save.

   {{< img src="/img/keycloak-jwt/client.png" alt="Example client" >}}

9. Retrieve the client secret from the Credentials tab under the client you just created.

   {{< img src="/img/keycloak-jwt/client-secret.png" alt="Retrieve client secret" >}}

10. Generate your JWT using `curl`. This is the token you will use to access your services through the Tyk Gateway. You can generate your JWT using either of the following methods. Make sure to replace the `KEYCLOAK` prefixed parameters with the appropriate values.

    **Password Grant Type:**

    ```bash
    curl -L --insecure -s -X POST 'https://KEYCLOAK_URL/realms/KEYCLOAK_REALM/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
       -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
       --data-urlencode 'client_id=KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID' \
       --data-urlencode 'grant_type=password' \
       --data-urlencode 'client_secret=KEYCLOAK_SECRET' \
       --data-urlencode 'scope=openid' \
       --data-urlencode 'username=KEYCLOAK_USERNAME' \
       --data-urlencode 'password=KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD'
    ```

    **Client Credentials Grant Type:**

    ```bash
    curl -L --insecure -s -X POST 'https://KEYCLOAK_URL/realms/KEYCLOAK_REALM/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
       -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
       --data-urlencode 'client_id=KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID' \
       --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
       --data-urlencode 'client_secret=KEYCLOAK_SECRET'
    ```

    A typical response will look something like this:

    ```yaml
    {
       "access_token": "...", 
       "expires_in": 300,
       "refresh_expires_in": 1800,
       "refresh_token": "...",
       "token_type": "Bearer",
       "id_token": "...",
       "not-before-policy": 0,
       "session_state": "...",
       "scope": "openid profile email"
    }
    ```

##### Running in k8s

If you are looking to POC this functionality in Kubernetes, you can run a fully worked-out example using our tyk-k8s-demo library. You can read more [here]({{< ref "getting-started/quick-start/tyk-k8s-demo" >}}).


#### Create Your JWT API in Tyk

1. Log in to your Tyk Dashboard.
2. Create a new HTTP API (the default `http://httpbin.org` upstream URL is fine).

   {{< img src="/img/api-management/security/jwt-keycloak-api-create.png" alt="Create a new HTTP API" >}}

3. Scroll to the Authentication mode section and select JWT from the list.
4. Select RSA public Key as JWT Signing method.
5. Add your JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) URL in the Public Key box. This can be found through the well-known config endpoint or is typically `https://KEYCLOAK_URL/realms/KEYCLOAK_REALM/protocol/openid-connect/certs`.
6. Add an Identity Source and Policy Field Name. The defaults of `sub` and `pol` are fine.
7. Click on the update button to save the API.

   {{< img src="/img/api-management/security/jwt-keycloak-set-auth.png" alt="Create API" >}}

8. Create a policy to manage access to your API.
9. Navigate to the Policies section on the left-hand side menu.
10. Click on Add Policy on the top right-hand side of your screen.
11. Select your API from the Add API Access Rights list.

   {{< img src="/img/api-management/security/jwt-keycloak-add-policy.png" alt="Select API for Security Policy" >}}

12. Click on the Configurations tab and choose a policy name and TLL.

    {{< img src="/img/api-management/security/jwt-keycloak-add-policy-cont.png" alt="Create API Security Policy" >}}

13. Add the default policy to the API.

    {{< img src="/img/api-management/security/jwt-keycloak-api-set-policy.png" alt="Add default policy to API" >}}

14. Test access to the API using curl.
15. Retrieve the API URL.

    {{< img src="/img/api-management/security/jwt-keycloak-get-api-url.png" alt="Add default Policy to API" >}}

16. Test with curl. Make sure to replace `TOKEN` with the JWT you received from the curl earlier.

    ```bash
    curl 'friendly-slipper-gw.aws-use1.cloud-ara.tyk.io/keycloak.jwt/get' \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
    ```




#### Split Token

OAuth2, OIDC, and their foundation, JWT, have been industry standards for many years and continue to evolve, particularly with the iterative improvements in the OAuth RFC, aligning with FHIR and Open Banking principles. The OAuth flow remains a dominant approach for secure API access.

In the OAuth flow, two types of access tokens are commonly used: opaque and JWT (more precisely, JWS). However, the use of JWTs has sparked debates regarding security, as JWTs can leak information when base64 decoded. While some argue that JWTs should not contain sensitive information, others consider JWTs inherently insecure for authorization.

##### Introduction to Split Token Flow

JWT Access Tokens can carry sensitive information, making them vulnerable if compromised. The Split Token Flow offers a solution by storing only the JWT signature on the client side while keeping the header and payload on the server side. This approach combines the flexibility of JWTs with the security of opaque tokens, ensuring that sensitive data is not exposed.

##### How Tyk Implements Split Token Flow

Tyk API Gateway is well-positioned to broker the communication between the client and the authorization server. It can handle requests for new access tokens, split the JWT, and return only the signature to the client, storing the rest of the token internally.

Here’s how you can implement the Split Token Flow using the client credentials flow:

##### Request a JWT Access Token

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
https://keycloak-host/auth/realms/tyk/protocol/openid-connect/token \
-d grant_type=client_credentials \
-d client_id=efd952c8-df3a-4cf5-98e6-868133839433 \
-d client_secret=0ede3532-f042-4120-bece-225e55a4a2d6 -s | jq
```

This request returns a JWT access token.

###### Split the JWT

The JWT consists of three parts:

* Header: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9`
* Payload: `eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyLCJlbWFpbCI6ImhlbGxvQHdvcmxkLmNvbSJ9`
* Signature: `EwIaRgq4go4R2M2z7AADywZ2ToxG4gDMoG4SQ1X3GJ0`

Using the Split Token Flow, only the signature is returned to the client, while the header and payload are stored server-side by Tyk.

{{< img src="/img/2.10/split_token2.png" alt="Split Token Example" >}}

###### Create a Virtual Endpoint in Tyk

Create a virtual endpoint or API in Tyk to handle the token request. This endpoint receives the auth request, exchanges credentials with the authorization server, and returns the split token.

**Example script for the Virtual Endpoint:**

```javascript
function login(request, session, config) {
    var credentials = request.Body.split("&")
        .map(function(item, index) {
            return item.split("=");
        }).reduce(function(p, c) {
            p[c[0]] = c[1];
            return p;
        }, {});

    var newRequest = {
        "Headers": {"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
        "Method": "POST",
        "FormData": {
            grant_type: credentials.grant_type,
            client_id: credentials.client_id,
            client_secret: credentials.client_secret
        },
        "Domain": "https://keycloak-host",
        "resource": "/auth/realms/tyk/protocol/openid-connect/token",
    };

    var response = TykMakeHttpRequest(JSON.stringify(newRequest));
    var usableResponse = JSON.parse(response);

    if (usableResponse.Code !== 200) {
        return TykJsResponse({
            Body: usableResponse.Body,
            Code: usableResponse.Code
        }, session.meta_data)
    }

    var bodyObj = JSON.parse(usableResponse.Body);
    var accessTokenComplete = bodyObj.access_token;
    var signature = accessTokenComplete.split(".")[2];

    log("completeAccessToken: " + accessTokenComplete);

    // Create key inside Tyk
    createKeyInsideTyk(signature, bodyObj);

    // Override signature
    bodyObj.access_token = signature;
    delete bodyObj.refresh_expires_in;
    delete bodyObj.refresh_token;
    delete bodyObj.foo;

    var responseObject = {
        Body: JSON.stringify(bodyObj),
        Code: usableResponse.Code
    }
    return TykJsResponse(responseObject, session.meta_data);
}
```

This script handles the login process, splits the JWT, and stores the necessary information in Tyk.

Once the setup is complete, you can test the Split Token Flow by making API calls using the opaque token returned by the virtual endpoint. Tyk will validate the token and reconstruct the full JWT for upstream services.

```bash
$ curl localhost:8080/basic-protected-api/get -H "Authorization: MEw….GJ0"
```

This request uses the opaque token, which Tyk validates and then injects the full JWT into the Authorization header for the API request.

#### Configure your JWT Setup
Learn how to configure and manage JWT authentication in your Tyk API Gateway.


##### Set Up JWT Signing Method
Select the cryptographic method to verify JWT signatures from the following options:

- RSA public key
- HMAC shared secret
- ECDSA
- [Public JWKS URL](#enable-dynamic-public-key-rotation-using-jwks)

{{< note success >}}
**Note**: Leave the field blank to configure at the key level.
{{< /note >}} 

To generate an RSA keypair, use the following commands:
```bash
openssl genrsa -out key.rsa 
openssl rsa -in key.rsa -pubout > key.rsa.pub
```


##### Set Up Individual JWT Secrets
Enable Tyk to validate an inbound token using stored keys:

1. Set up your token with the following fields:
    ```{.json}
    "jwt_data": {
      "secret": "Secret"
    }
    ```
2. Ensure the `kid` header field is included in the JWT for validation.
   - If the `kid` header is missing, Tyk will check the `sub` field. This is not recommended but supported.

The advantage of using RSA is that only the hashed ID and public key of the end user are stored, ensuring high security.


##### Configure Identity Source and Policy Field Name
Define the identity and policy applied to the JWT:

- **Identity Source**: Select which identity claim to use (e.g., `sub`) for rate-limiting and quota counting.
- **Policy Field Name**: Add a policy ID claim to the JWT that applies a specific security policy to the session.


##### Enable Dynamic Public Key Rotation Using JWKs
Instead of a static public key, configure a public JSON Web Key Sets (JWKs) URL to dynamically verify JWT tokens:

1. Use the JWKs URL to dynamically maintain and rotate active public keys.
2. Ensure JWTs contain the `kid` header, matching the `kid` in the JWK payload for verification.


{{< img src="/img/2.10/jwt_rsa_public_key.png" alt="JWKS Public Key Rotation" >}}


For example, cURLing the JWKs URL returns:

```{.copyWrapper}
$ curl http://keycloak_host:8081/auth/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/certs
{
  "keys": [
      {
          "kid": "St1x2ip3-wzbrvdk4yVa3-inKWdOwbkD3Nj3gpFJwYM",
          "kty": "RSA",
          "alg": "RS256",
          "use": "sig",
          "n": "k-gUvKl9-sS1u8odZ5rZdVCGTe...m2bMmw",
          "e": "AQAB",
          "x5c": [
              "MIICmzCCAYMCBgFvyVrRq....K9XQYuuWSV5Tqvc7mzPd/7mUIlZQ="
          ],
          "x5t": "6vqj9AeFBihIS6LjwZhwFLmgJXM",
          "x5t#S256": "0iEMk3Dp0XWDITtA1hd0qsQwgES-BTxrz60Vk5MjGeQ"
      }
  ]
}
```

This is a JWKS complaint payload as it contains the "x5c" entry which contains the public key. Also, the issuer generates the ID Token or Access Token with a header that includes a "kid" that matches the one in the JWKS payload.

Here's an example of a header belonging to an access token generated by the issuer above.
```{.json}
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "kid": "St1x2ip3-wzbrvdk4yVa3-inKWdOwbkD3Nj3gpFJwYM"
}
```

The Bearer tokens will be signed by the private key of the issuer, which in this example is our keycloak host.  This bearer token can be verified by Tyk using the public key available in the above payload under "x5C".

All of this happens automatically.  You just need to specify to Tyk what the JWKs url is, and then apply a "sub" and default policy in order for everything to work.  See Step #3, 4, and 5 under option #1 for explanations and examples.



##### Adjust JWT Clock Skew Configuration
Prevent token rejection due to clock skew between servers by configuring clock skew values:

- `jwt_issued_at_validation_skew`
- `jwt_expires_at_validation_skew`
- `jwt_not_before_validation_skew`

All values are in seconds. The default is `0`.


##### Map JWT Scopes to Policies
Assign JWT scopes to security policies to control access:

1. Specify scope-to-policy mapping:

```{.copyWrapper}
  "jwt_scope_to_policy_mapping": {
    {
    "admin": "59672779fa4387000129507d",
    "developer": "53222349fa4387004324324e"
  },
  "jwt_scope_claim_name": "our_scope"
}
```
  - `"jwt_scope_to_policy_mapping"` provides mapping of scopes (read from claim) to actual policy ID. I.e. in this example we specify that scope "admin" will apply policy `"59672779fa4387000129507d"` to a key
- `"jwt_scope_claim_name"` identifies the JWT claim name which contains scopes. This API Spec field is optional with default value `"scope"`. This claim value could be any of the following:
  - a string with space delimited list of values (by standard)
  - a slice of strings
  - a string with space delimited list of values inside a nested key. In this case, provide `"jwt_scope_claim_name"` in dot notation. For eg. `"scope1.scope2"`, `"scope2"` will be having the list of values nested inside `"scope1"`
  - a slice of strings inside a nested key. In this case, provide `"jwt_scope_claim_name"` in dot notation. For eg. `"scope1.scope2"`, `"scope2"` will be having a slice of strings nested inside `"scope1"`

2. Set the claim name that contains the scopes (default: `scope`):
    ```{.json}
    "jwt_scope_claim_name": "our_scope"
    ```

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

Several scopes in JWT claim will lead to have several policies applied to a key. In this case all policies should have `"per_api"` set to `true` and shouldn't have the same `API ID` in access rights. I.e. if claim with scopes contains value `"admin developer"` then two policies `"59672779fa4387000129507d"` and `"53222349fa4387004324324e"` will be applied to a key (with using our example config above).

##### Visualize JWT Flow in Tyk API Gateway
View the diagram below for an overview of JWT flow in Tyk:

{{< img src="/img/diagrams/diagram_docs_JSON-web-tokens@2x.png" alt="JSON Web Tokens Flow" >}}


### Use Open (Keyless) Authentication

Open or keyless authentication allows access to APIs without any authentication. This method is suitable for public APIs where access control is not required.

#### Configure the API as Open or Keyless in Tyk

In Tyk, configure the API to not require any authentication for access.
To implement keyless access, simply set the flag in your API Definition:

```{.copyWrapper}
{
  ...
  "use_keyless": true,
  "auth": {
      "auth_header_name": ""
  },
  ...
}
```
This will stop checking keys that are proxied by Tyk.

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

Keyless APIs cannot be selected for [Access Rights]({{< ref "getting-started/create-security-policy" >}}) in a security policy.
{{< /note >}}

#### Request a Public Resource

Access the API directly without any authentication tokens or credentials.

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://api.example.com/public-resource
```

**Request:**

| Parameter | Value                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Method**  | `GET`                                   |
| **URL**     | The API endpoint for the public resource. |


**Request:**

| Parameter       | Value                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Method**      | `GET`                                |
| **URL**         | The API endpoint for the protected resource. |
| **Authorization** | Bearer token, e.g., `Bearer ID_TOKEN`. |



## Combine Authentication Methods

### Multiple (Chained) Authentication

As of Tyk v2.3, it is possible to have multiple authentication middleware chained together. For example, you can use an Access Token in combination with Basic Auth or with a JSON Web Token. Below is a video demonstration of this functionality:

{{< youtube-seo id="vYGYYXcJ6Wc" title="Protect an API with Multiple Authentication Types">}}

#### Enable Multi (Chained) Authentication with the Dashboard

To enable multi-chained authentication in your GUI, follow these steps:

1.  Browse to the "Authentication" Section

    First, navigate to the Endpoint Designer and view the "Core Settings" tab. In this section, you can choose various authentication methods. For this setup, you will configure multiple auth providers, which works slightly differently than setting up a single auth method.

2.  Select the Multiple Auth Mechanisms Option

    Select the Use Multiple Auth Mechanisms option from the drop-down list. This will open a window that provides checkboxes for each supported auth type to be chained. Note that it is not possible to set the order of chained auth methods.

    {{< img src="/img/api-management/security/multiple-auth-choose-auth.png" alt="Select Multiple Auth" >}}

3.  Select Your Preferred Auth Methods and Base Identity Provider

    Choose the authentication methods you want to chain together and select the base identity provider. The baseline provider will be the one that provides the current request context with the session object, defining the "true" access control list, rate limit, and quota to apply to the user.

    {{< img src="/img/api-management/security/multiple-auth-methods.png" alt="Select Auth Methods" >}}

    Once these are set up, you will see the traditional configuration screens for each of the auth methods selected in the checkboxes. Configure them as you would regular authentication modes.

#### Enable Multi (Chained) Authentication in Your API Definition

To enable this mode, set the `base_identity_provided_by` field in your API Definitions to one of the supported chained enums below:

*   `AuthToken`
*   `HMACKey`
*   `BasicAuthUser`
*   `JWTClaim`
*   `OIDCUser`
*   `OAuthKey`
*   `UnsetAuth`

The provider set here will then be the one that provides the session object that determines rate limits, ACL rules, and quotas.

Tyk will chain the auth mechanisms as they appear in the code and will default to an auth token if none are specified. You can explicitly set auth token support by setting `use_standard_auth` to `true`.

#### Enable Multi (Chained) Authentication with Tyk Operator

Please consult the [Tyk Operator](/product-stack/tyk-operator/advanced-configurations/client-authentication#multiple-chained-auth) supporting documentation for an example of how to enable multi chained authentication with Tyk Operator.


## Use Python CoProcess and JSVM Plugin Authentication

Tyk allows for custom authentication logic using Python and JavaScript Virtual Machine (JSVM) plugins. This method is useful for implementing unique authentication mechanisms that are tailored to your specific requirements.

* See [Custom Authentication with a Python plugin]({{< ref "plugins/supported-languages/rich-plugins/python/custom-auth-python-tutorial" >}}) for a detailed example of a custom Python plugin.
* See [JavaScript Middleware]({{< ref "plugins/supported-languages/javascript-middleware" >}}) for more details on using JavaScript Middleware. 


## Set Physical Key Expiry and Deletion
Tyk makes a clear distinction between an API authorization key expiring and being deleted from the Redis storage.

- When a key expires, it remains in the Redis storage but is no longer valid. Consequently, it is no longer authorized to access any APIs. If a key in Redis has expired and is passed in an API request, Tyk will return `HTTP 401 Key has expired, please renew`.
 - When a key is deleted from Redis, Tyk no longer knows about it, so if it is passed in an API request, Tyk will return `HTTP 400 Access to this API has been disallowed`.

Tyk provides separate control for the expiration and deletion of keys.

Note that where we talk about keys here, we are referring to [Session Objects]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/what-is-a-session-object" >}}), also sometimes referred to as Session Tokens

### Key expiry

Tyk's API keys ([token session objects]({{< ref "tyk-apis/tyk-gateway-api/token-session-object-details" >}})) have an `expires` field. This is a UNIX timestamp and, when this date/time is reached, the key will automatically expire; any subsequent API request made using the key will be rejected.

### Key lifetime

Tyk does not automatically delete keys when they expire. You may prefer to leave expired keys in Redis storage, so that they can be renewed (for example if a user has - inadvisedly - hard coded the key into their application). Alternatively, you may wish to delete keys to avoid cluttering up Redis storage with obsolete keys.

You have two options for configuring the lifetime of keys when using Tyk:

1.  At the API level
2.  At the Gateway level

#### API-level key lifetime control

You can configure Tyk to delete keys after a configurable period (lifetime) after they have been created. Simply set the `session_lifetime` field in your API Definition and keys created for that API will automatically be deleted when that period (in seconds) has passed.

The default value for `session_lifetime` is 0, this is interpreted as an infinite lifetime which means that keys will not be deleted from Redis.

For example, to have keys live in Redis for only 24 hours (and be deleted 24 hours after their creation) set:

```{.json}
"session_lifetime": 86400
```

{{< note success >}} 
**Note**

There is a risk, when configuring API-level lifetime, that a key will be deleted before it has expired, as `session_lifetime` is applied regardless of whether the key is active or expired. To protect against this, you can configure the [session_lifetime_respects_key_expiration]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#session_lifetime_respects_key_expiration" >}}) parameter in your `tyk.conf`, so that keys that have exceeded their lifetime will not be deleted from Redis until they have expired.
{{< /note >}}

This feature works nicely with [JWT](#use-json-web-tokens-jwt) or [OIDC](#use-openid-connect) authentication methods, as the keys are created in Redis the first time they are in use so you know when they will be removed. Be extra careful in the case of keys created by Tyk (Auth token or JWT with individual secrets) and set a long `session_lifetime`, otherwise the user might try to use the key **after** it has already been removed from Redis.

#### Gateway-level key lifetime control

You can set a global lifetime for all keys created in the Redis by setting [global_session_lifetime]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#global_session_lifetime" >}}) in the `tyk.conf` file; this parameter is an integer value in seconds.

To enable this global lifetime, you must also set the [force_global_session_lifetime]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#force_global_session_lifetime" >}}) parameter in the `tyk.conf` file.

#### Summary of key lifetime precedence

The table below shows the key lifetime assigned for the different permutations of `force_global_session_lifetime` and  `session_lifetime_respects_key_expiration` configuration parameters.
| `force_global_session_lifetime` | `session_lifetime_respects_key_expiration` | Assigned lifetime |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `true`                          | `true`                                     | `global_session_lifetime`                 |
| `true`                          | `false`                                    | `global_session_lifetime`                 |
| `false`                         | `true`                                     | larger of `session_lifetime` or `expires` |
| `false`                         | `false`                                    | `session_lifetime`                        |

{{< note success >}} 
**Note**

It is important to remember that a value of `0` in `session_lifetime` or `global_session_lifetime` is interpreted as infinity (i.e. key will not be deleted if that control is in use) - and if a field is not set, this is treated as `0`.
<br>
If you want the key to be deleted when it expires (i.e. to use the expiry configured in `expires` within the key to control deletion) then you must set a non-zero value in `session_lifetime` and configure both `session_lifetime_respects_key_expiration:true` and `force_global_session_lifetime:false`.

## Enable Mutual TLS

Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a robust security feature that ensures both the client and server authenticate each other using TLS certificates. This two-way authentication process provides enhanced security for API communications by verifying the identity of both parties involved in the connection.

### Why Use Mutual TLS?

Mutual TLS is particularly valuable in environments where security is paramount, such as microservices architectures, financial services, healthcare, and any scenario requiring zero-trust security. It not only encrypts the data in transit but also ensures that the communicating parties are who they claim to be, mitigating the risks of unauthorized access and data breaches.

### Concepts

#### How Does Mutual TLS Work?

Mutual TLS operates by requiring both the client and server to present and verify TLS certificates during the handshake process. Here’s how it works:

**Client Authentication:**

1. When a client attempts to connect to the server, the server requests the client’s TLS certificate.
2. The client provides its certificate, which the server verifies against a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Server Authentication:**

1. Simultaneously, the client also verifies the server’s certificate against a trusted CA.

This mutual verification ensures that both parties are legitimate, securing the connection from both ends.

#### Benefits of Mutual TLS

* **Enhanced Security:** Provides two-way authentication, ensuring both the client and server are verified and trusted.
* **Data Integrity:** Protects the data exchanged between client and server by encrypting it, preventing tampering or interception.
* **Compliance:** Helps meet stringent security and compliance requirements, especially in regulated industries.


### mTLS for cloud users:
- Cloud users can secure their upstream services with mTLS but mTLS between the client (caller of the API) and Tyk's gateway cannot be done for the time being.
- Multi cloud users - since you own and manage the gateways, you can use mTLS for gateway <--> upstream  as well as client <--> gateway connections.

### Client mTLS

There are two ways to set up client mTLS in Tyk: static and dynamic. Each method is suited to different use cases, as outlined below:

| Use Case                                                           | Static | Dynamic |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----: | :-----: |
| Let developers upload their own public certificates through the Developer Portal |   ❌    |   ✅      |
| Combine client mTLS with another authentication method           |   ✅    |   ✅      |
| Allow certs at the API level (one or more APIs per cert)           |   ✅    |   ❌      |
| Allow certs at an individual level (one or more APIs per cert)     |   ❌    |   ✅      |

#### Dynamic Client mTLS

Dynamic Client mTLS in Tyk allows you to authenticate users based solely on the provided client certificate, without the need for an additional authentication key. Tyk can identify the user, apply policies, and monitor usage just as with regular API keys.

To set up Dynamic Client mTLS, we need to follow these steps:
* Protect the API: Configure the API in the API Designer by setting the authentication type to Auth Token and enabling Client Certificate.

* Generate a Self-Signed Certificate: Use OpenSSL to generate a self-signed certificate and key if you don't have one.

* Add a Key in the Dashboard: In the Tyk Dashboard, create a key for the API and upload only the public certificate.

* Make an API Request: Use curl with your certificate and key to make an API request to the protected API, ensuring the request returns a 200 response.

* Allow Developers to Upload Certificates: Create a policy and catalog entry for the API, allowing developers to request keys and upload their public certificates through the Developer Portal. Developers can then make API requests using their cert and private key.


##### Protect the API

In the API Designer, set the Authentication Type to Auth Token under Target Details > Authentication mode. Then select Enable Client Certificate.

{{< img src="/img/api-management/security/client-mtls-api-setup.png" alt="Enable Client Certificate" >}}

##### Generate a Self-Signed Key Pair

If you don’t already have a certificate, generate a self-signed key pair using the following command:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

##### Add a Key through the Dashboard

In the Tyk Dashboard, add a key for the API you set up in step #1. When uploading the certificate, ensure you only upload the public certificate.


{{< note success >}}
**Note**  
The certificate you upload for this key must only be the public certificate.
{{< /note >}}


##### Make an API Request Using the Certificate

Now you can make a cURL request to the API using the certificate and private key:

```bash
curl -k --cert cert.pem --key key.pem https://localhost:8080/mtls-api/my-endpoint
```

A successful request should return a 200 response.

##### Allow Developers to Upload Certificates

Instead of manually creating keys, you can allow developers to upload their own certificates via the Developer Portal.

1. **Create a Policy:** Create a policy for the API you set up earlier.
2. **Create a Catalog Entry:** Create a catalog entry for this policy.
3. **Request a Key through the Portal:** As a developer, request a key for the API through the Portal. This will present a screen where the developer can upload their public certificate.

4. **Make an API Request Using the Uploaded Certificate:** After adding the public certificate, developers can make API requests using their cert + private key:

   ```bash
   curl -k --cert cert.pem --key key.pem https://localhost:8080/mtls-api/my-endpoint
   ```

   A successful request should return a 200 response.

#### Static mTLS

Static mTLS allows client certificates to be used at the API level. This method is straightforward and can be combined with another authentication method if needed.

##### Configure the API

In the API authentication settings, choose mTLS as the authentication type and optionally select an additional authentication method. If you want to use only client certificates without another authentication method, select "keyless" as the other option.

##### Set the Base Identity

The base identity can be anything, as the client certificate will be the primary authentication method.


##### Setup Static mTLS in Tyk Operator using the Tyk Classic API Definition{#tyk-operator-classic}

This setup requires mutual TLS (mTLS) for client authentication using specified client certificates. The example provided shows how to create an API definition with mTLS authentication for `httpbin-client-mtls`.

1. **Generate Self-Signed Key Pair:**

You can generate a self-signed key pair using the following OpenSSL command:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

2. **Create Kubernetes Secret:**

Create a secret in Kubernetes to store the client certificate:

```bash
kubectl create secret tls my-test-tls --cert cert.pem --key key.pem
```

3. **Create API Definition:**

Below is the YAML configuration for an API that uses mTLS authentication. Note that the `client_certificate_refs` field references the Kubernetes secret created in the previous step.

```yaml {hl_lines=["19-21"],linenos=false}
apiVersion: tyk.tyk.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApiDefinition
metadata:
  name: httpbin-client-mtls
spec:
  name: Httpbin Client MTLS
  protocol: http
  active: true
  proxy:
    target_url: http://httpbin.org
    listen_path: /httpbin
    strip_listen_path: true
  version_data:
    default_version: Default
    not_versioned: true
    versions:
      Default:
        name: Default
  use_mutual_tls_auth: true
  client_certificate_refs:
    - my-test-tls
```

##### Setup Static mTLS in Tyk Operator using Tyk OAS API Definition{#tyk-operator-oas}

Client certificates, In Tyk OAS API Definition, are managed using the `TykOasApiDefinition` CRD. You can reference Kubernetes secrets that store client certificates in your API definitions.

**Example of Referencing Client Certificates in Tyk OAS**

In this example, the `clientCertificate` section allows you to enable client certificate management and specify a list of Kubernetes secrets (`tls-cert`) that store allowed client certificates.

```yaml {hl_lines=["48-50"],linenos=false}
# Secret is not created in this manifest.
# Please store client certificate in k8s TLS secret `tls-cert`.

apiVersion: v1
data:
  test_oas.json: |-
    {
        "info": {
          "title": "Petstore",
          "version": "1.0.0"
        },
        "openapi": "3.0.3",
        "components": {},
        "paths": {},
        "x-tyk-api-gateway": {
          "info": {
            "name": "Petstore",
            "state": {
              "active": true
            }
          },
          "upstream": {
            "url": "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2"
          },
          "server": {
            "listenPath": {
              "value": "/petstore/",
              "strip": true
            }
          }
        }
      }

##### FAQ

*   **Why am I getting an error stating that certificates are not enabled for this API?**

    This issue can occur because client mTLS is an extension of Auth Token authentication mode. To enable this feature, ensure the API definition has `auth.use_certificate` set to `true`.

*   **Can I upload a full certificate chain when creating a key for dynamic client mTLS?**

    Yes, you can do this when manually creating a key as an Admin Dashboard user. However, through the Portal, you must upload only the public key (certificate).

*   **Can I use a root CA with client mTLS?**

    Yes, Tyk allows you to upload a root CA certificate for static mTLS authentication. This setup allows clients with certificates signed by the registered CA to be validated.

    **Key Points:**

    *   The root CA certificate can be uploaded as a client certificate.
    *   Clients presenting certificates signed by this CA will be validated.
    *   Tyk traverses the certificate chain for validation.
{{< note success >}}
  **Note** 
  Root CA certificates are compatible only with Static mTLS and not with Dynamic mTLS.

### Upstream mTLS

If your upstream API is protected with mutual TLS (mTLS), you can configure Tyk to send requests with the specified client certificate. This ensures secure communication between Tyk and your upstream services.

#### Key Features of Upstream mTLS

*   **Certificate Per Host:** You can specify one certificate per host and define a default certificate.
*   **API-Level or Global Configuration:** Upstream certificates can be defined at the API level or globally via the Gateway configuration file.
*   **JSVM Middleware Support:** Specified client certificates will be used not only for internal Tyk calls but also for HTTP calls inside your JSVM middleware.

#### How To Set Up Upstream mTLS

To set up upstream mTLS in your API definition, you should configure the `upstream_certificates` field in the following format:

```yaml
{
  "upstream_certificates": {
    "example.com": "<cert-id>"
  }
}
```

If you want to configure this at a global level, specify it via the `security.certificates.upstream` field in your Gateway configuration file.

#### Via Dashboard

To configure upstream mTLS using the Tyk Dashboard:

1.  Navigate to the API Designer.
2.  Go to the Advanced Options panel.
3.  Find the Upstream Certificates section and attach the appropriate certificate.

    {{< img src="/img/2.10/attach_upstream_cert.png" alt="upstream_cert" >}}

#### Via Tyk Operator using the Tyk Classic API Definition{#tyk-operator-classic}

Tyk Operator supports configuring upstream mTLS using one of the following fields within the ApiDefinition object:

- **upstream_certificate_refs**: Configure using certificates stored within Kubernetes secret objects.
- **upstream_certificates**: Configure using certificates stored within Tyk Dashboard's certificate store.

##### upstream_certificate_refs

The `upstream_certificate_refs` field can be used to configure certificates for different domains. References can be held to multiple secrets which are used for the domain mentioned in the key. Currently "*" is used as a wildcard for all the domains

The example listed below shows that the certificate in the secret, *my-test-tls*, is used for all domains.

```yaml
# First apply this manifest using the command
# "kubectl apply -f config/samples/httpbin_upstream_cert.yaml"
#
# The operator will try to create the ApiDefinition and will succeed but will log an error that a certificate is missing
# in the cluster for an upstream
#
# Generate your public-private key pair , for test you can use the following command to obtain one fast:
# "openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out tls.crt -keyout tls.key"
#
# Run the following command to obtain the values that must be put inside the yaml that contians the secret resource:
# "kubectl create secret tls my-test-tls --key="tls.key" --cert="tls.crt" -n default -o yaml --dry-run=client"
#
# Apply your TLS certificate using the following command: (we already have an example one in our repo)
# "kubectl apply -f config/sample/simple_tls_secret.yaml"
#
# NOTE: the upstream_certificate_refs can hold references to multiple secrets which are used for the domain
# mentioned in the key (currently "*" is used as a wildcard for all the domains)
apiVersion: tyk.tyk.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApiDefinition
metadata:
  name: httpbin
spec:
  name: httpbin
  use_keyless: true
  upstream_certificate_refs:
    "*": my-test-tls
  protocol: http
  active: true
  proxy:
    target_url: http://httpbin.org
    listen_path: /httpbin
    strip_listen_path: true
  version_data:
    default_version: Default
    not_versioned: true
    versions:
      Default:
        name: Default
```

A secret can be created and output in yaml format using the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret tls my-test-tls --key="keyfile.key" --cert="certfile.crt" -n default -o yaml --dry-run=client
kubectl apply -f path/to/your/tls_secret.yaml
```

##### upstream_certificates

The `upstream_certificates` field allows certificates uploaded to the certificate store in Tyk Dashboard to be referenced in the Api Definition:

```yaml
# Skip the concatenation and .pem file creation if you already have a certificate in the correct format

# First generate your public-private key pair , for test use you can use the following command to obtain one fast:
# "openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out tls.crt -keyout tls.key"

# Concatenate the above files to obtain a .pem file which we will upload using the dashboard UI
# "cat tls.crt tls.key > cert.pem"

# Upload it to the tyk certificate store using the dashboard

# Fill in the manifest with the certificate id (the long hash) that you see is given to it in the dashboard
# (in place of "INSERT UPLOADED CERTIFICATE NAME FROM DASHBOARD HERE")
# Optional: Change the domain from "*" to something more specific if you need to use different
# upstream certificates for different domains

# Then apply this manifest using the command
# "kubectl apply -f config/samples/httpbin_upstream_cert_manual.yaml"

# The operator will try create the ApiDefinition and will succeed and it will have the requested domain upstream certificate
# in the cluster for an upstream

# NOTE: the upstream_certificate can hold multiple domain-certificateName pairs
# (currently "*" is used as a wildcard for all the domains)

apiVersion: tyk.tyk.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApiDefinition
metadata:
  name: httpbin
spec:
  name: httpbin
  use_keyless: true
  upstream_certificates:
    "*": #INSERT UPLOADED CERTIFICATE NAME FROM DASHBOARD HERE#
  protocol: http
  active: true
  proxy:
    target_url: http://httpbin.org
    listen_path: /httpbin
    strip_listen_path: true
  version_data:
    default_version: Default
    not_versioned: true
    versions:
      Default:
        name: Default
```

#### Via Tyk Operator using Tyk OAS API Definition{#tyk-operator-oas}
Tyk Operator supports configuring upstream mTLS using the `mutualTLS` field in `TykOasApiDefinition` object:

```yaml{hl_lines=["12-18"],linenos=false}
apiVersion: tyk.tyk.io/v1alpha1
 kind: TykOasApiDefinition
 metadata:
   name: petstore
   namespace: default
 spec:
   tykOAS:
     configmapRef:
       name: petstore
       namespace: default
       keyName: petstore.json
   mutualTLS:
     enabled: true
     domainToCertificateMapping:
       - domain: "petstore.com"
         certificateRef: petstore-domain
       - domain: "petstore.co.uk"
         certificateRef: petstore-uk-domain
```



#### Domain Configuration

When specifying the domain for the upstream certificate, do **NOT** include the protocol (e.g., `https://`). Including the protocol will prevent Tyk from matching the certificates to the correct domain.

**Incorrect:** `https://api.production.myupstream.com`

**Correct:** `api.production.myupstream.com`

If the request is made via a non-standard HTTP port, you need to include the port in the domain:

**Correct:** `api.production.myupstream.com:8443`

#### Wildcards

You may use wildcards in combination with text to match the domain, but this only works one level deep.

For example, if your domain is `api.production.myupstream.com`:

**Correct:** `*.production.myupstream.com`

**Incorrect:** `*.myupstream.com`

#### Default Upstream Certificate

To set a default client certificate, use `*` instead of a domain name:

```yaml
{
  "upstream_certificates": {
    "*": "<cert-id>"
  }
}
```

This configuration will apply the specified certificate to all upstream requests that do not match a more specific domain.

## Conclusion
