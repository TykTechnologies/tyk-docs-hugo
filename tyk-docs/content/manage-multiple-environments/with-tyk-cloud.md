With a pure Tyk Cloud setup, multiple environment management is not possible because all traffic will run via our proxy and our infrastructure.

It is possible to use the Tyk Cloud interface to manage multiple environments when you have Hybrid gateways running in your environments and those can be targeted appropriately.
