## Introduction
Tyk Dashboard reuqires a persistent datastore for its operations. By default MongoDB is used. From Tyk v4.0, we also support PostgreSQL. 

### MongoDB Support Versions and Drop-in Replacement
MongoDB is our default storage option. We support the following versions:
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) 4.4.x

Note: Tyk works with MongoDB 3.x and above too, but we no longer test MongoDB versions prior to 4.4 since they are EOL

You can also use the following as a drop-in replacement for MongoDB:
* [Amazon DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/) 3.6 and 4 engine
* [Azure CosmosDB for MongoDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/introduction) 3.6 and 4 engine

Please check [here]({{< ref "planning-for-production/database-settings/mongodb.md" >}}) for production configurations.

### PostgreSQL Support Versions and Drop-in Replacement
From Tyk 4.0, you can use PostgreSQL as your datastore. We support the following versions:
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) version 11.x, 12.x, 13.x, 14.x, 15.x

You can also use the following as a drop in replacement for PostgreSQL:
* [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)
* [Azure CosmosDB for PostgreSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/postgresql/introduction)

Please check [here]({{< ref "planning-for-production/database-settings/postgresql.md" >}}) for production configurations.

In a production environment, we **only** support the PostgreSQL versions listed above.

For POC, you can also use the following as replacement:
* SQLite 3.x

## Other v4.0 Database features

As well as SQL platform support, we have introduced 4 separate data storage layers. You can configure each layer separately to use one of our supported database platforms, or use a single platform for all layers. The data storage layers are as follows:
1. `main` storage for APIs, Policies, Users, User Groups.
2. `analytics` used for displaying all charts and analytics screens.
3. `logs` log storage as used in the log browser page.
4. `uptime` storing uptime tests analytics.

All data stored in SQL platforms will be identical to our existing MongoDB support.

## Which platform should you use?

We recommend the following:

* For PoC installations, you can use any of the following platforms (SQLite, PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
* For production installations, we **only** support MongoDB or PostgreSQL

## Configuring SQL

See the following pages for configuring your SQL installation with Tyk:
