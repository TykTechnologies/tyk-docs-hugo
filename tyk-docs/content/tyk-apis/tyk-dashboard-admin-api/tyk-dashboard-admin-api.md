The Dashboard Admin API is a special bootstrapping API that can be used to set up and provision a Tyk Dashboard instance without the command line and is used by the bootstrap scripts that come with a Tyk On-Premises installation.

> **Note**: This API should only be used mostly for bootstrapping purposes, all actual interactions with dashboard objects should be done via the regular API.
