The lab phase is an early release stage of our product, during which features are still under active development and testing. This phase is crucial for gathering user feedback and improving the product before its official release.

## Important aspects to know when using *Lab Releases* products

- **Not Ready for Production Use:** Lab products are not intended for use in production environments.
- **Potential Issues:** You may encounter bugs, unexpected behaviour, and other issues as the product is still being refined.
