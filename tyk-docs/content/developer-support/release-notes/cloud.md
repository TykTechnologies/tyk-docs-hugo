<summary>Clearer LTS Version Support & Recommendations</summary>

Tyk Cloud now provides improved visibility into supported LTS versions. Every patch version within the current LTS branch is labeled `Supported`, while the latest patch is marked as `Recommended`.

#### Changed

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved Organization Overview Page</summary>

We have redesigned the Overview page in Tyk Cloud to provide a more streamlined and actionable summary of an organization's key elements.
Users can now toggle between two views:
- **Task View**: Groups control planes and developer portals by high-level jobs to be done, such as managing APIs or publishing products.
- **Environment View**: Displays control planes and developer portals grouped by environment, making it easier to navigate large setups.
Additionally, we have moved organization statistics to a new System Usage page under Deployments.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

#### Fixed

<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Removed "Delete User" Button for Team Admins</summary>

Team admins will no longer see the `Delete User` button when viewing the profiles of other team admins. Previously, this button was incorrectly displayed, leading to an error when clicked. This fix ensures the UI reflects the correct permissions and prevents confusion for administrators managing team members.
</details>
</li>    
</ul>

### 1.24.2 Release Notes

#### Release Date 13 of January 2025

#### Release Highlights

This Tyk Cloud update resolves an issue related to Telemetry export configurations.

#### Fixed

<ul>
<li>
<details>

<li>
<details>
<summary>"Delete User" button hidden for org admin on Org+Billing admin profiles</summary>

The "Delete User" button for Org Admins has been hidden when viewing Org+Billing Admin profiles on the Teams page. Previously, Org Admins could see this button but would encounter an error message, "operation on this class is not permitted," when attempting deletion.

</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Standardized behavior for "Upgrade" and "Account & Billing" buttons</summary>

The behavior for accessing the billing app through the 'Upgrade' and 'Account & Billing' buttons has been standardized. Previously, clicking the 'Upgrade' button opened the billing app in a new tab, while 'Account & Billing' opened it in the same tab. Now, both buttons open the billing app consistently in the same tab.
</details>
</li>


<li>
<details>
<summary>Direct access to "/password-reset" page now accessible without redirect</summary>

Fixed an issue where accessing the /password-reset page directly redirected users to the login page. Now, users can navigate directly to the /password-reset page without being redirected, providing a consistent experience for password-reset requests regardless of how the page is accessed.

<li>
<details>
<summary>Billing sidebar display corrected when no subscriptions are present</summary>

<summary>Fix for hybrid codes visibility logic to manage node data retention</summary>

This update addresses a critical bug in the Hybrid nodes visibility logic, which previously retained all connected node data for the Hybrid Data Planes indefinitely.

This enhancement improves system performance at all stages within the Tyk Cloud UI for organizations with Hybrid Data Planes, especially those with multiple connected gateways.
