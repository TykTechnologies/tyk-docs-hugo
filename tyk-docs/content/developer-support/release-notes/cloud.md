Previously, when deploying a Data Plane in a region different from the Control Plane, Telemetry export settings could encounter compatibility issues.

### 1.24.0

### Release Date 16 of December 2024

### Release Highlights

This Tyk Cloud update introduces a groundbreaking feature for enhanced API observability and troubleshooting. With the new native Telemetry export, Tyk Cloud now allows organizations to seamlessly integrate their deployments with a variety of popular observability platforms, including built-in support for Datadog, Dynatrace, Elastic, and New Relic. For other systems, the custom provider option ensures compatibility with any platform that supports the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP).

This feature enables trace export capabilities, providing deep insights into API and plugin performance. It marks the first step in Tyk Cloud’s broader observability journey, empowering users to monitor and troubleshoot their APIs more effectively while leveraging their existing observability tools.
