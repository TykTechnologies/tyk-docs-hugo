Tyk provides the *do_not_track* configuration parameter to disable tracking analytics at two levels:
    - Global: Analytics are not tracked for all endpoints of an API.
    - Endpoint: Analaytics are not track for a specified endpoint.
    
This feature is configurable for both [Tyk OAS APIs](TODO) and [Tyk Classic APIs](TODO). It is also configurable from within the Tyk Dashboard [endpoint designer](TODO).
