Instructions for upgrading Tyk gateway. You should follow the same flow for Tyk Dashboard, Tyk Pump and MDCB.

1. Backup your gateway config file (`tyk.conf` or the name you chose for it).  Note this step may not be    relevant if youâ€™re exclusively using the environment variables from the values.yaml to define your configuration.
2. Update the image version in your values.yaml
   <br>
   For example, in this [values.yaml](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-charts/blob/83de0a184014cd027ec6294b77d034d6dcaa2a10/components/tyk-gateway/values.yaml#L142) change the version of the tag `tag: v5.1` to the version you want.
3. Run `Helm upgrade` with your relevant `values.yaml` file/s.

   Check the [helm upgrade docs](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for more details on the `upgrade` command.
