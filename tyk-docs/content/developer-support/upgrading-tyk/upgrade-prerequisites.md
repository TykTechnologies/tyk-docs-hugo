When considering upgrading your current configuration to a new Tyk release, our team recommends you consider the following:

- **Which upgrade strategy do you intend to use: [Rolling]({{< ref "developer-support/upgrading-tyk/upgrade-strategy#rolling-upgrade" >}}) or [Blue-Green]({{< ref "developer-support/upgrading-tyk/upgrade-strategy#blue-green" >}})**
    - If following the Blue-Green upgrade strategy, has the green environment been configured and verified as production-ready?
    - If pursuing the Rolling upgrade strategy, do all Tyk components have a second instance?
- **What operating system is currently in use?**
    - Was Tyk deployed via a repository or a local package file .rpm (CentOS or RHEL) or .deb (Debian or Ubuntu)?
    - Is the targeted version available on [packagecloud.io/tyk](https://packagecloud.io/tyk) or the intended version?
- **Have backups been performed?**
    - Have databases been properly backed up?
    - Are the configuration files safely backed up?
    - Have you tested your backups?
- **Are there any custom plugins?**
    - Do they need to be recompiled using the guide listed in the [table](#next-steps) below appropriate for your platform?
