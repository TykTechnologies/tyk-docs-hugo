## What is Tyk Gateway ?

The primary application for Community Edition users and Pro users alike, the Tyk Open Source API Gateway does all the heavy lifting of actually managing your requests: traffic proxying, access control, data transformation, logging and more.

Tyk can run completely independently, requiring only a Redis database to be effective, and can scale horizontally:

The Tyk Gateway will take inbound requests, run them through a set of middleware components which apply transforms and any other service-specific operations, and then proxy the request out again to the origin, intercepting the response, running a set of response middleware and then returning.

Tyk can also run dynamic middleware components written in JavaScript, and from v2.3 other languages, at either end of the built-in middleware.
