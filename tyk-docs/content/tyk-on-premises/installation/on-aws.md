Tyk offers a flexible and powerful API management solution through **Tyk Cloud** on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-pboluroscnqro). Tyk Cloud is an end-to-end managed API platform where both the control plane and gateways are installed on AWS for a seamless, fully cloud-hosted experience.

For those who need more deployment flexibility, Tyk Cloud also supports a [Hybrid Gateway]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/environments-deployments/hybrid-gateways" >}}) option. In this setup, the control plane remains hosted and managed by Tyk on AWS, while the gateways can be deployed on your preferred cloud provider or on-premises environment—allowing you to meet data locality and compliance needs without sacrificing control.
