## <a name="install-dashboard"></a>Install Tyk Dashboard: RedHat

Tyk has its own signed RPMs in a yum repository hosted by the kind folks at [packagecloud.io][1], which makes it easy, safe and secure to install a trusted distribution of the Tyk Gateway stack.

This tutorial will run on an [Amazon AWS][2] *Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1* instance. We will install Tyk Dashboard with all dependencies stored locally.

We're installing on a `t2.micro` because this is a tutorial, you'll need more RAM and more cores for better performance.

This configuration should also work (with some tweaks) for CentOS.

**Pre-requisites**:

*   Ensure port `3000` is open: This is used by the Dashboard to provide the GUI and the Developer Portal
*   EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) is a free, community based repository project from Fedora which provides high quality add-on software packages for Linux distribution including RHEL, CentOS, and Scientific Linux. EPEL isn't a part of RHEL/CentOS but it is designed for major Linux distributions. In our case we need it for Redis DB. Install EPEL using the instructions [here][3].
*   Install Redis DB using EPEL
*   Tyk requires Python 3.4. Install via the following command:

```{.copyWrapper}
sudo yum install python34
```

### Step 1: Set up yum repositories

First, we need to install some software that allows us to use signed packages:
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo yum install pygpgme yum-utils wget
``` 

Next, we need to set up the various repository configurations for Tyk Dashboard and MongoDB:

### Step 2: Configure Tyk Dashboard

Create a file named `/etc/yum.repos.d/tyk_tyk-dashboard.repo` that contains the repository configuration below. https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-dashboard/install#manual-rpm
```{.copyWrapper}
[tyk_tyk-dashboard]
name=tyk_tyk-dashboard
baseurl=https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-dashboard/el/7/$basearch
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=http://keyserver.tyk.io/tyk.io.rpm.signing.key
       https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-dashboard/gpgkey
sslverify=1
sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
metadata_expire=300
```

### Step 3: Configure MongoDB

Create a `/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-3.0.repo` file so that you can install MongoDB directly, using yum.
```{.copyWrapper}
[mongodb-org-3.0]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-org/3.0/x86_64/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
```

Finally we'll need to update our local cache, so run:
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo yum -q makecache -y --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo='tyk_tyk-dashboard'
```

### Step 4: Install packages

We're ready to go, you can now install the relevant packages using yum:
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo yum install -y mongodb-org tyk-dashboard
```

*(you may be asked to accept the GPG key for our repos and when the package installs, hit yes to continue)*

### Step 5: Start MongoDB

In many cases MongoDB not be running, so let's start that:
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo service mongod start
```

### Step 6: Configure Tyk Dashboard

We can set the Dashboard up with a similar setup command, the below will get the Dashboard set up for the local instance:
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo /opt/tyk-dashboard/install/setup.sh --listenport=3000 --redishost=localhost --redisport=6379 --mongo=mongodb://127.0.0.1/tyk_analytics --tyk_api_hostname=$HOSTNAME --tyk_node_hostname=http://localhost --tyk_node_port=8080 --portal_root=/portal --domain="XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
```

> **Note**: Make sure to use the actual DNS hostname or the public IP of your instance as the last parameter.

What we have done here is:

*   `--listenport=3000`: Told Tyk Dashboard (and Portal) to listen on port 3000.
*   `--redishost=localhost`: Tyk Dashboard should use the local Redis instance.
*   `--redisport=6379`: The Tyk Dashboard should use the default port.
*   `--domain="XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"`: Bind the Dashboard to the IP or DNS hostname of this instance (required).
*   `--mongo=mongodb://127.0.0.1/tyk_analytics`: Use the local MongoDB (should always be the same as the Gateway).
*   `--tyk_api_hostname=$HOSTNAME`: The Tyk Dashboard has no idea what hostname has been given to Tyk, so we need to tell it, in this instance we are just using the local HOSTNAME env variable, but you could set this to the public-hostname/IP of the instance.
*   `--tyk_node_hostname=http://localhost`: The Tyk Dashboard needs to see a Tyk node in order to create new tokens, so we need to tell it where we can find one, in this case, use the one installed locally.
*   `--tyk_node_port=8080`: Tell the Dashboard that the Tyk node it should communicate with is on port 8080.
*   `--portal_root=/portal`: We want the Portal to be shown on /portal of whichever domain we set for the Portal.

### Step 7: Start Tyk Dashboard
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo service tyk-dashboard start
``` 

Notice how we haven't actually started the gateway yet, because this is a Dashboard install, we need to enter a license first.

### Step 8: Enter Dashboard license

Go to `http://your-host-name:3000/`.

You will see a screen asking for a license, enter it in the section marked "**Already have a license?**" and click `Use this license`.

That's it, your Dashboard is now ready to be bootstrapped.

> **Note:** You can bypass this step by adding your license manually to the `/var/opt/tyk-dashboard/tyk_analytics.conf` file directly in the field marked `license`.

If all is going well, you will be taken to a log in screen - we'll get to that soon.

### Step 9: Restart the Dashboard process

Because we've just entered a license via the UI, we need to make sure that these changes get picked up, so to make sure things run smoothly, we restart the Dashboard process (you only need to do this once) and (if you have it installed) then start the gateway:
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo service tyk-dashboard restart 
```

### Step 10: Bootstrap the Dashboard with an initial user and organisation

When the Tyk Dashboard is created for the first time, it has no initial user base or organisation to add data to, so we need to add this.

The best way to add this data is with the Admin API, to make it really easy we've supplied a bootstrap script that will set you up. If you want to customise it, take a look at the file in `/opt/tyk-dashboard/install/bootstrap.sh`.

**Pre-requisites for this command**

*   This command assumes you are running on a Linux shell such as Bash
*   This command assumes you have Python 2.7 or 3.4 installed

**To bootstrap your instance**:

```{.copyWrapper}
sudo /opt/tyk-dashboard/install/bootstrap.sh XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
``` 

This command tells the bootstrap script to use the localhost as the base for the API calls, you can run the bootstrap remotely and change the first command line parameter to the DNS hostname of your instance.

You will now be able to log into and test your Tyk instance with the values given to you by the bootstrap script.

## <a name="configure"></a> Configure Tyk Dashboard

We can set the Dashboard up with a helper setup command script, the below will get the Dashboard set up for the local instance:
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo /opt/tyk-dashboard/install/setup.sh --listenport=3000 --redishost=localhost --redisport=6379 --mongo=mongodb://127.0.0.1/tyk_analytics --tyk_api_hostname=$HOSTNAME --tyk_node_hostname=http://localhost --tyk_node_port=8080 --portal_root=/portal --domain="XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
```

> **Note**: Make sure to use the actual DNS hostname or the public IP of your instance as the last parameter.

What we have done here is:

*   `--listenport=3000`: Told Tyk Dashboard (and Portal) to listen on port 3000.
*   `--redishost=localhost`: The Tyk Dashboard should use the local Redis instance.
*   `--redisport=6379`: The Tyk Dashboard should use the default port.
*   `--domain="XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"`: Bind the Dashboard to the IP or DNS hostname of this instance (required).
*   `--mongo=mongodb://127.0.0.1/tyk_analytics`: Use the local MongoDB (should always be the same as the gateway).
*   `--tyk_api_hostname=$HOSTNAME`: The Tyk Dashboard has no idea what hostname has been given to Tyk, so we need to tell it, in this instance we are just using the local HOSTNAME env variable, but you could set this to the public-hostname/IP of the instance.
*   `--tyk_node_hostname=http://localhost`: The Tyk Dashboard needs to see a Tyk node in order to create new tokens, so we need to tell it where we can find one, in this case, use the one installed locally.
*   `--tyk_node_port=8080`: Tell the Dashboard that the Tyk node it should communicate with is on port 8080.
*   `--portal_root=/portal`: We want the portal to be shown on `/portal` of whichever domain we set for the portal.

### Step 1: Start Tyk Dashboard
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo service tyk-dashboard start
```

Notice how we haven't actually started the gateway yet, because this is a Pro install, we need to enter a license first.

### Step 2: Enter your dashboard license

Go to `http://your-host-name:3000/`.

You will see a screen asking for a license, enter it in the section marked "**Already have a license?**" and click `Use this license`.

That's it, your Dashboard is now ready to be bootstrapped.

> **Note:** You can bypass this step by adding your license manually to the `/var/opt/tyk-dashboard/tyk_analytics.conf` file directly in the field marked `license`.

If all is going well, you will be taken to a log in screen - we'll get to that soon.

### Step 3: Restart the dashboard and start the gateway process

Because we've just entered a license via the UI, we need to make sure that these changes get picked up, so to make sure things run smoothly, we restart the dashboard process (you only need to do this once) and then start the gateway:
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo service tyk-dashboard restart 
sudo service tyk-gateway start
```

### Step 4: Bootstrap the Dashboard with an initial User and Organisation

When the Tyk Dashboard is created for the first time, it has no initial user base or organisation to add data to, so we need to add this.

The best way to add this data is with the Admin API, to make it really easy we've supplied a bootstrap script that will set you up. If you want to customise it, take a look at the file in `/opt/tyk-dashboard/install/bootstrap.sh`.

**Pre-requisites for this command**:

*   This command assumes you have Python 2.7 or 3.4 installed

**To bootstrap your instance**:
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo /opt/tyk-dashboard/install/bootstrap.sh XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
```

This command tells the bootstrap script to use the localhost as the base for the API calls, you can run the bootstrap remotely and change the first command line parameter to the DNS hostname of your instance.

You will now be able to log into and test your Tyk instance with the values given to you by the bootstrap script.
