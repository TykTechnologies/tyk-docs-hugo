You will see a 200 response with your new key:
```
    {
        "api_model": {},
        "key_id": "59bf9159adbab8abcdefghijac9299a1271641b94fbaf9913e0e048c",
        "data": {...}
    }
```

The value returned in the `key_id` parameter of the response is the access key you can now use to access the API that was specified in the `access_rights` section of the call.
