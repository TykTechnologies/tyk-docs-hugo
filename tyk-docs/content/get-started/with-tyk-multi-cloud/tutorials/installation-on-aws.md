> **NOTE**: Tyk Multi-Cloud has superseded our Hybrid offering. See [Tyk Multi-Cloud](https://tyk.io/api-gateway/cloud/#multi-cloud) for more details. You can get a free 30 day trial of Tyk Multi-Cloud.

Tyk Multi-Cloud Gateway can be installed on AWS infrastructure using our AWS Marketplace AMI product. Once subscribed to it and a Tyk Cloud account is created please follow this guide to set up an instance.

## <a name="requirements"></a>Requirements

To get started make sure you have:

1. A Tyk Multi-Cloud account. Click [here][1] for details of how to create one
2. A subscription to the [Tyk Hybrid Gateway AMI from the AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07BVPCL4R)

## <a name="quick-setup"></a>Quick setup

This guide assumes the "1-Click" install was selected on the Marketplace and an instance is already running. At the end we also provide several "user data" samples for use through `cloud-init` [automation](#automation), and of course any automation tool of choice can be used with our AMIs.

### To obtain Hybrid credentials

1.  Go to <https://admin.cloud.tyk.io> and login with your new details.
2.  Click "Users" and select your name, you will see your Organisation ID, take note of this:
    
    ![RPC credentials][2]

### To setup a Tyk Hybrid Gateway instance provisioned by the "1-Click" option

1. Connect to the instance using SSH (make sure to use the key specified during the provisioning), e.g. `ssh -i your_key.pem ec2-user@instance.address`
2. Once inside the instance execute `sudo /opt/tyk-gateway/setup_hybrid.sh -o your-organisation-id -k your-api-key` (more options described below)
3. If everything went well, Tyk Hybrid Gateway will be running on port 8080, with a Redis storage server running on the same instance
4. Make sure your EC2 security groups attached to the instance allow inbound traffic on port 8080

That's it, a fully ready to use Tyk Gateway connected to a Hybrid account is set up and should be available for use through the instance's address.

## <a name="configuration"></a>Configuration

The Gateway can be more finely tuned for this first setup using the following command line options to the `setup_hybrid.sh` script:

* `-s` or `--secret`: the Gateway node secret to be used for admin API, if not specified â€” it would be auto-generated and displayed by the script
* `-t` or `--type`: type of the process to use (can be `python`, `lua` or left out for default), if specified this starts a gateway process ready to use with either Python or Lua plugins (see documentation on customising Tyk)
* `-o` or `--orgid`: the organisation ID, taken from the Cloud dashboard
* `-k` or `--apikey`: the API key, taken from the Cloud dashboard
* `-p` or `--port`: listen port for the Tyk Gateway process (the same port should be open for the instance ingress)
* `-c` or `--conf`: replace the default tyk.conf with a custom one from location on local FS specified by this option
* `--redis-host`: Redis storage hostname, if not specified a local Redis server will be started and used for this instance
* `--redis-port`: Redis storage server port, defaults to 6379
* `--redis-user`: Redis storage authentication username, defaults to empty
* `--redis-pass`: Redis storage authentication password, defaults to empty
* `--redis-db`: Redis storage database number, defaults to 0
* `--redis-use-ssl`: if set, the Redis connection will assume it's encrypted (use with Redis providers that support in-transit encryption)
* `--no-bind-slugs`: if set, the gateway will listen to API IDs as root paths instead of API slugs (default)

This is just a portion of configuration options available for the gateway to facilitate a quick setup. The [rest][4] may be set by either editing/replacing the `/opt/tyk-gateway/tyk.conf` file or adding [environment variables][3] to `/etc/default/tyk-gateway` file.


## <a name="automation"></a>Automation

While the instructions above are sufficient for manually setting up a single Tyk Gateway instance, one may need to launch more with the help of automation. One common way to do this on AWS is by using an EC2 auto-scaling group.

The AMI to which a customer subscribes may be specified in a launch configuration for the auto-scaling group, however instances launched this way would not be in a configured state. In order to configure them on launch automatically, "user data" can be specified in the launch configuration in order to instruct `cloud-init` to perform certain actions once on launched instances. This allows to do initial setup immediately or install some provisioning tool (like puppet, chef, ansible, salt, etc.) and run it.

Here's a very simple "user data" snippet that configures a Tyk Hybrid Gateway process using `setup_hybrid.sh` script the same way as [Quick setup](#quick-setup) section instructs manually:

```{.copyWrapper}
#cloud-config
runcmd:
  - [ /opt/tyk-gateway/setup_hybrid.sh, -o, "orgidhere", -k, "apikeyhere", -s, "gwapisecrethere"]
```

Or alternatively, a more verbose sample that does the same without using the script in case a more granular configuration is required:

```{.copyWrapper}
#cloud-config
write_files:
  - content: |
    TYK_GW_LISTENPORT=8080
    TYK_GW_SECRET="test12345replaceme"
    TYK_GW_STORAGE_HOST="localhost"
    TYK_GW_STORAGE_PORT=6379
    TYK_GW_STORAGE_USERNAME=""
    TYK_GW_STORAGE_PASSWORD=""
    TYK_GW_SLAVEOPTIONS_RPCKEY="orgidhere"
    TYK_GW_SLAVEOPTIONS_APIKEY="apikeyhere"
  path: /etc/default/tyk-gateway

runcmd:
  - [ mv, /etc/init/tyk-gateway.disabled, /etc/init/tyk-gateway.conf ]
  - [ mv, /opt/tyk-gateway/tyk_hybrid.conf, /opt/tyk-gateway/tyk.conf ]
  - [ service, redis, start ]
  - [ chkconfig, --level, "2345", redis, "on" ]
  - [ start, tyk-gateway ]
```

## <a name="ami-notes"></a>Notes on AMI

The Tyk Hybrid Gateway AMI is based on the latest (at the moment of creation) Amazon Linux AMI (**not** Amazon Linux 2), which itself is based on CentOS 6. Please refer to [Amazon Linux documentation][5] for details as well as [our notes on init systems][6] used in Linux distributions for details on how to manage the process and extract service logs.

Attributes for [ENA/SR-IOV][7] are set on this AMI and since Amazon Linux comes pre-packaged with related drivers it's eligible for use with EC2 instance types supporting these types of networking (such as "c5" class).
