## Get started with Tyk

Tyk comes in three powerful flavours: Cloud, Multi-Cloud and On-Premises. Each has its own strengths and reasons for deployment. To get started, why not check out the guides?

- [Tyk Cloud][1]: The fastest way to explore Tyk â€“ no setup, no installations, just a straight-up cloud-based API gateway and proxy.
- [Tyk Multi-Cloud][2]: Get the best of both worlds, manage things from our cloud but get one or more Tyk Gateway's in your infrastructure.
- [Tyk On-Premises][3]: A full Tyk stack in your own infrastructure, it doesn't call home, it's all yours and you can do with it what you like. This is the most flexible Tyk deployment you could have.
- [Tyk Community Edition][4]: Tyk Community Edition is the open-source API Gateway that is developed by our community and supported by our community members and advocates (with some help from the Tyk Technologies team).
