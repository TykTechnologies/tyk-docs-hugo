The Tyk Pump is our Open Source analytics purger that moves the data generated by your Tyk nodes to any back-end.  By moving the analytics into MongoDB, it allows the Tyk Dashboard to display traffic analytics across all your gateways.

### Supported Backends
- MongoDB (Used by Tyk Dashboard)
- CSV
- Elasticsearch (2.0+)
- Graylog
- InfluxDB
- Moesif
- Splunk
- StatsD
- DogStatsD
- Hybrid (Tyk RPC)
- Prometheus
- Logz.io
- Kafka

### Configuration

Please visit the public [GitHub Readme](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-pump) for instructions on installing and configuring the various Pump backends.

#### Tyk Dashboard

The Tyk Dashboard uses the `mongo-pump-aggregate` collection to display analytics. This is different than the standard `mongo` pump plugin that will store individual analytic items into MongoDB. The aggregate functionality was built to be fast, as querying raw analytics is expensive in large data sets. See [Pump Dashboard Config](/docs/tyk-configuration-reference/tyk-pump-dashboard-config/) for more details.

### Capping analytics data

Tyk Gateways can generate a lot of analytics data. Be sure to read about [capping your Dashboard analytics](/docs/analytics-and-reporting/capping-analytics-data-storage/)
