## How to send Tyk Gateway traces to New Relic

At the moment Tyk currently uses [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/) to export distributed traces. Support for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is on the near-term roadmap for us. More information can be found on [this community post](https://community.tyk.io/t/faq-opentelemetry-distributed-tracing/5682).

[New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) has a Trace API that can be used to [import distributed traces in the OpenTracing/Zipkin format](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/distributed-tracing/trace-api/report-zipkin-format-traces-trace-api/). Below is an example configuration to export the traces generated by Tyk in the OpenTracing/Zipkin format and to export them to the New Relic Trace API.

## Configuring New Relic

In `tyk.conf` on `tracing` setting

```.json
{
  "tracing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "name": "zipkin",
    "options": {}
  }
}
```

`options` are settings that are used to initialise the Zipkin client.

# Sample configuration

```.json
{
  "tracing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "name": "zipkin",
    "options": {
      "reporter": {
        "url": "https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1?Api-Key=NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY&Data-Format=zipkin&Data-Format-Version=2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`reporter.url` is the URL to the New Relic server, where trace data will be sent.
