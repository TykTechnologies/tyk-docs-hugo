In some cases you may want to compose multiple API calls or multiple APIs into a bundled or batched request. This is possible with Tyk and can be easily achieved using our [Virtual Endpoint](/docs/advanced-configuration/compose-apis/virtual-endpoints/) and the Batch Request section of the [Tyk Gateway API](/docs/tyk-gateway-api/) features.
