## Overview {#allow-list-overview}

The Allow List middleware is a feature designed to restrict access to only specific API endpoints. It rejects requests to endpoints not specifically "allowed", returning `HTTP 403 Forbidden`. This enhances the security of the API by preventing unauthorized access to endpoints that are not explicitly permitted.

Note that this is not the same as Tyk's [IP allow list]({{< ref "api-management/gateway-config-tyk-classic#ip-access-control" >}}) feature, which is used to restrict access to APIs based upon the IP of the requestor.

### Use Cases

#### Restricting access to private endpoints

If you have a service that exposes endpoints or supports methods that you do not want to be available to clients, you should use the allow list to perform strict restriction to a subset of methods and paths. If the allow list is not enabled, requests to endpoints that are not explicitly defined in Tyk will be proxied to the upstream service and may lead to unexpected behavior.

### Working

Tyk Gateway does not actually maintain a list of allowed endpoints but rather works on the model whereby if the *allow list* middleware is added to an endpoint then this will automatically block all other endpoints.

Tyk Gateway will subsequently return `HTTP 403 Forbidden` to any requested endpoint that doesn't have the *allow list* middleware enabled, even if the endpoint is defined and configured in the API definition.

**Note**

If you enable the allow list feature by adding the middleware to any endpoint, ensure that you also add the middleware to any other endpoint for which you wish to accept requests.

#### Case sensitivity

By default the allow list is case-sensitive, so for example if you have defined the endpoint `GET /userID` in your API definition then only calls to `GET /userID` will be allowed: calls to `GET /UserID` or `GET /userid` will be rejected. You can configure the middleware to be case-insensitive at the endpoint level.

You can also set case sensitivity for the entire [gateway]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway/configuration#ignore_endpoint_case" >}}) in the Gateway configuration file `tyk.conf`. If case insensitivity is configured at the gateway level, this will override the endpoint-level setting.

#### Endpoint parsing

When using the allow list middleware, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with Tyk's [URL matching]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/url-matching" >}}) options.

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

Tyk recommends that you use [exact]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/url-matching#exact-match" >}}) matching for maximum security, though prefix and wildcard strategies might also apply for your particular deployment or use case.

## Using Tyk OAS {#allow-list-using-tyk-oas}

The [allow list]({{< ref "api-management/traffic-transformation#allow-list-overview" >}}) is a feature designed to restrict access to only specific API endpoints. It rejects requests to endpoints not specifically "allowed", returning `HTTP 403 Forbidden`. This enhances the security of the API by preventing unauthorized access to endpoints that are not explicitly permitted.

When working with Tyk OAS APIs the middleware is configured in the [Tyk OAS API Definition]({{< ref "api-management/gateway-config-tyk-oas#operation" >}}). You can do this via the Tyk Dashboard API or in the API Designer.

If you're using the legacy Tyk Classic APIs, then check out the [Tyk Classic]({{< ref "api-management/traffic-transformation#allow-list-using-classic" >}}) page.


### API Definition

The design of the Tyk OAS API Definition takes advantage of the `operationId` defined in the OpenAPI Document that declares both the path and method for which the middleware should be added. Endpoint `paths` entries (and the associated `operationId`) can contain wildcards in the form of any string bracketed by curly braces, for example `/status/{code}`. These wildcards are so they are human readable and do not translate to variable names. Under the hood, a wildcard translates to the “match everything” regex of: `(.*)`.

The allow list middleware (`allow`) can be added to the `operations` section of the Tyk OAS Extension (`x-tyk-api-gateway`) in your Tyk OAS API Definition for the appropriate `operationId` (as configured in the `paths` section of your OpenAPI Document).

The `allow` object has the following configuration:

- `enabled`: enable the middleware for the endpoint
- `ignoreCase`: if set to `true` then the path matching will be case insensitive

For example:

```json {hl_lines=["47-50", "53-56"],linenos=true, linenostart=1}
{
    "components": {},
    "info": {
        "title": "example-allow-list",
        "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "openapi": "3.0.3",
    "paths": {
        "/anything": {
            "get": {
                "operationId": "anythingget",
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": ""
                    }
                }
            },
            "put": {
                "operationId": "anythingput",
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": ""
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "x-tyk-api-gateway": {
        "info": {
            "name": "example-allow-list",
            "state": {
                "active": true
            }
        },
        "upstream": {
            "url": "http://httpbin.org/"
        },
        "server": {
            "listenPath": {
                "value": "/example-allow-list/",
                "strip": true
            }
        },
        "middleware": {
            "operations": {
                "anythingget": {
                    "allow": {
                        "enabled": true,
                        "ignoreCase": true
                    }                
                },
                "anythingput": {
                    "allow": {
                        "enabled": true,
                        "ignoreCase": true
                    }                
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example the allow list middleware has been configured for requests to the `GET /anything` and `PUT /anything` endpoints. Requests to any other endpoints will be rejected with `HTTP 403 Forbidden`, unless they also have the allow list middleware enabled.
Note that the allow list has been configured to be case insensitive, so calls to `GET /Anything` will be allowed
Note also that the endpoint path has not been terminated with `$`. Requests to, for example, `GET /anything/foobar` will be allowed as the [regular expression pattern match]({{< ref "api-management/traffic-transformation#endpoint-parsing" >}}) will recognize this as `GET /anything`.

The configuration above is a complete and valid Tyk OAS API Definition that you can import into Tyk to try out the allow list feature.

### API Designer

Adding the allow list to your API endpoints is easy is easy when using the API Designer in the Tyk Dashboard, simply follow these steps:

1. **Add an endpoint**

    From the **API Designer** add an endpoint that matches the path and method to which you want to apply the middleware.

    {{< img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-no-endpoints.png" alt="Tyk OAS API Designer showing no endpoints created" >}}

    {{< img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-add-endpoint.png" alt="Adding an endpoint to an API using the Tyk OAS API Designer" >}}

    {{< img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-no-middleware.png" alt="Tyk OAS API Designer showing no middleware enabled on endpoint" >}}

2. **Select the Allow List middleware**

    Select **ADD MIDDLEWARE** and choose the **Allow List** middleware from the *Add Middleware* screen.

    {{< img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-allow.png" alt="Adding the Allow List middleware" >}}

3. **Optionally configure case-insensitivity**

    If you want to disable case-sensitivity for the allow list, then you must select **EDIT** on the Allow List icon.

    {{< img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-allow-added.png" alt="Allow List middleware added to endpoint - click through to edit the config" >}}

    This takes you to the middleware configuration screen where you can alter the case sensitivity setting.
    {{< img src="/img/dashboard/api-designer/tyk-oas-allow-config.png" alt="Configuring case sensitivity for the Allow List" >}}

    Select **UPDATE MIDDLEWARE** to apply the change to the middleware configuration.

4. **Save the API**

    Select **SAVE API** to apply the changes to your API.

## Using Classic {#allow-list-using-classic}

The [allow list]({{< ref "api-management/traffic-transformation#allow-list-overview" >}}) is a feature designed to restrict access to only specific API endpoints. It rejects requests to endpoints not specifically "allowed", returning `HTTP 403 Forbidden`. This enhances the security of the API by preventing unauthorized access to endpoints that are not explicitly permitted.

When working with Tyk Classic APIs the middleware is configured in the Tyk Classic API Definition. You can do this via the Tyk Dashboard API or in the API Designer.

If you're using the newer Tyk OAS APIs, then check out the [Tyk OAS]({{< ref "api-management/traffic-transformation#allow-list-using-tyk-oas" >}}) page.

### API Definition

To enable and configure the allow list you must add a new `white_list` object to the `extended_paths` section of your API definition.

{{< note success >}}
**Note**

Historically, Tyk followed the out-dated whitelist/blacklist naming convention. We are working to remove this terminology from the product and documentation, however this configuration object currently retains the old name.
{{< /note >}}

The `white_list` object has the following configuration:

- `path`: the endpoint path
- `method`: this should be blank
- `ignore_case`: if set to `true` then the path matching will be case insensitive
- `method_actions`: a shared object used to configure the [mock response]({{< ref "api-management/traffic-transformation#configuring-mock-response-using-tyk-dashboard-ui" >}}) middleware

The `method_actions` object should be configured as follows, with an entry created for each allowed method on the path:

- `action`: this should be set to `no_action`
- `code`: this should be set to `200`
- `headers` : this should be blank

For example:

```json  {linenos=true, linenostart=1}
{
    "extended_paths": {
        "white_list": [
            {
                "disabled": false,
                "path": "/status/200",
                "method": "",
                "ignore_case": false,
                "method_actions": {
                    "GET": {
                        "action": "no_action",
                        "code": 200,
                        "headers": {}
                    },
                    "PUT": {
                        "action": "no_action",
                        "code": 200,
                        "headers": {}
                    }            
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

In this example the allow list middleware has been configured for HTTP `GET` and `PUT` requests to the `/status/200` endpoint. Requests to any other endpoints will be rejected with `HTTP 403 Forbidden`, unless they also have the allow list middleware enabled.
Note that the allow list has been configured to be case sensitive, so calls to `GET /Status/200` will also be rejected.
Note also that the endpoint path has not been terminated with `$`. Requests to, for example, `GET /status/200/foobar` will be allowed as the [regular expression pattern match]({{< ref "api-management/traffic-transformation#endpoint-parsing" >}}) will recognize this as `GET /status/200`.

Consult section [configuring the Allow List in Tyk Operator](#tyk-operator) for details on how to configure allow lists for endpoints using Tyk Operator.

### API Designer

You can use the API Designer in the Tyk Dashboard to configure the allow list middleware for your Tyk Classic API by following these steps.

1. **Add an endpoint for the path and select the plugin**

    From the **Endpoint Designer**, add an endpoint that matches the path for which you want to allow access. Select the **Whitelist** plugin.

2. **Configure the allow list**

    Once you have selected the middleware for the endpoint, the only additional feature that you need to configure is whether to make the middleware case insensitive by selecting **Ignore Case**.

    {{< img src="/img/2.10/whitelist.png" alt="Allowlist options" >}}

3. **Save the API**

    Use the *save* or *create* buttons to save the changes and activate the allow list middleware.

### Tyk Operator

Similar to the configuration of a Tyk Classic API Definition you must add a new `white_list` object to the `extended_paths` section of your API definition. Furthermore, the `use_extended_paths` configuration parameter should be set to `true`.

    versions:

        name: Default
        use_extended_paths: true
        paths:
          black_list: []
          ignored: []
          white_list: []
        extended_paths:
          white_list:
            - ignore_case: true
              method_actions:
                GET:
                  action: "no_action"
                  code: 200
                  data: ""
                  headers: {}
              path: "/get"
```

In this example the allow list middleware has been configured for `HTTP GET` requests to the `/get` endpoint. Requests to any other endpoints will be rejected with `HTTP 403 Forbidden`, unless they also have the allow list middleware enabled. Note that the allow list has been configured to case insensitive, so calls to `GET /Get` will also be accepted. Note also that the endpoint path has not been terminated with `$`. Requests to, for example, `GET /get/foobar` will be allowed as the [regular expression pattern match]({{< ref "api-management/traffic-transformation#endpoint-parsing" >}}) will recognize this as `GET /get`.
