## What is Tyk Open Source

Open source is at the heart of what we do. Anything that is API Gateway-related lives in the Gateway, or is critical for the Gateway to work is open and freely available via our [Github](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk).

The Tyk Gateway is fully open-source.  It's all the same Gateway that's used by you (the community!), by our enterprise products, as well as our SaaS.

Our commitment to open source also delivers a host of benefits for our users: sign up for free with Tyk, receive securely packaged open source packages, get started guides, access to our community and all of the latest open source information.

## Configuration Options for Redis

### Configure Redis Cluster

Our Gateway, Dashboard and Pump all support integration with Redis Cluster. Redis Cluster allows data to be automatically sharded across multiple Redis Nodes. To setup Redis Cluster correctly, we recommend you read the [Redis Cluster Tutorial](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial). You must use the same settings across the Gateway, Dashboard and Pump.

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

Redis Cluster operates differently from a Redis setup where one instance serves as the primary and others as replicas.
{{< /note >}}

#### Supported Versions
- Tyk 5.3 supports Redis 6.2.x, 7.0.x, and 7.2.x
- Tyk 5.2.x and earlier supports Redis 6.0.x and Redis 6.2.x only.


#### Redis Cluster and Tyk Gateway 

To configure the Tyk Gateway to work with your Redis Cluster, set `enable_cluster` to `true` and list your servers under `addrs` in your `tyk.conf` file.

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

`addrs` is new in v2.9.3, and replaces `hosts` which is now deprecated. 
{{< /note >}}

If you are using TLS for Redis connections, set `use_ssl` to `true`.

```json
"storage": {
  "type": "redis",
  "enable_cluster": true,
  "addrs": [
    "server1:6379",
    "server2:6380",
    "server3:6381"
  ],
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 2000,
  "optimisation_max_active": 4000,
  "use_ssl": false
},
```

#### Redis Cluster and Tyk Dashboard

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

`redis_addrs` is new in v1.9.3 for the Dashboard, and replaces `hosts` which is now deprecated. 
{{< /note >}}


```json
"redis_addrs": [
    "server1:6379",
    "server2:6380",
    "server3:6381"
  ],
"redis_use_ssl": true,
"enable_cluster": true
```
To configure the Tyk Dashboard to work with your Redis Cluster, add the Redis address information to your `tyk_analytics.conf` file:


#### Redis Cluster and Tyk Pump

To configure the Tyk Pump to work with your Redis Cluster, set `enable_cluster` to `true` and list your servers under `addrs` in your `pump.conf` file.

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

`addrs` is new in v2.9.3, and replaces `hosts` which is now deprecated. 
{{< /note >}}


```json
"analytics_storage_config": {
  "type": "redis",
  "enable_cluster": true,
  "addrs": [
    "server1:6379",
    "server2:6380",
    "server3:6381"
  ],
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 100,
  "use_ssl": false
},
```

#### Redis Cluster with Docker

For Redis clustered mode to work with Tyk using Docker and Amazon ElastiCache, follow these two steps:

1. **Make sure cluster mode is enabled**

Set the environment variable `TYK_GW_STORAGE_ENABLECLUSTER` to `true`.

2. **Add all cluster endpoints to the config**

Add all the Redis Cluster endpoints into Tyk, not just the primary. If Tyk can't see the whole cluster, then it will not work.

For ElastiCache Redis, you can bypass having to list all your nodes, and instead just use the *configuration endpoint*,
this allows read and write operations and the endpoint will determine the correct node to target.

If this does not work, you can still list out the hosts using an environment variable. To do so, set the environment variable:

```{.copyWrapper}
TYK_GW_STORAGE_ADDRS="redis_primary1:port,redis_replica1:port,redis_primary2:port,redis_replica2:port,redis_primary3:port,redis_replica3:port"
```

It is important that Tyk can connect to all primary and replica instances.

It is recommended to ensure that the connection pool is big enough. To do so, set the following environment variables:

```{.copyWrapper}
TYK_GW_STORAGE_MAXIDLE=6000
TYK_GW_STORAGE_MAXACTIVE=10000
```

**Note**  

These are suggested settings, please verify them by load testing.

##### Redis Cluster with TLS

If you are using TLS for Redis connections, set `use_ssl` to `true` for Gateway and Pump, and `redis_use_ssl` to `true` for the dashboard.
Redis supports [SSL/TLS encryption](https://redis.io/topics/encryption) from version 6 as an optional feature, enhancing the security of data in transit. Similarly, Amazon ElastiCache offers encryption in transit and at rest. To configure TLS or mTLS connections between an application and Redis, consider the following settings in Tyk's configuration files:

- `storage.use_ssl`: Set this to true to enable TLS encryption for the connection.

- `storage.ssl_insecure_skip_verify`: A flag that, when set to true, instructs the application not to verify the Redis server's TLS certificate. This is not recommended for production due to the risk of `man-in-the-middle` attacks.

From **Tyk 5.3**, additional options are available for more granular control:

- `storage.ca_file`: Path to the Certificate Authority (CA) file for verifying the Redis server's certificate.

- `storage.cert_file` and `storage.key_file`: Paths to your application's certificate and private key files, necessary for mTLS where both parties verify each other's identity.

- `storage.max_version` and `storage.min_version`: Define the acceptable range of TLS versions, enhancing security by restricting connections to secure TLS protocols (1.2 or 1.3).

**Setting up an Insecure TLS Connection**
- **Enable TLS**: By setting `"use_ssl": true`, you encrypt the connection.
- **Skip Certificate Verification**: Setting `"ssl_insecure_skip_verify": true` bypasses the server's certificate verification, suitable only for non-production environments.

**Setting up a Secure TLS Connection**
- Ensure `use_ssl` is set to `true`.
- Set `ssl_insecure_skip_verify` to `false` to enforce certificate verification against the CA specified in `ca_file`.
- Specify the path to the CA file in `ca_file` for server certificate verification.
- Adjust `min_version` and `max_version` to secure TLS versions, ideally 1.2 and 1.3.

**Setting up a Mutual TLS (mTLS) Connection**
- Follow the steps for a secure TLS connection.
- Provide paths for `cert_file` and `key_file` for your application's TLS certificate and private key, enabling Redis server to verify your application's identity.

**Example Gateway Configuration**
```json
"storage": {
  "type": "redis",
  "addrs": [
    "server1:6379",
    "server2:6380",
    "server3:6381"
  ],
  "use_ssl": true,
  "ssl_insecure_skip_verify": false,
  "ca_file": "/path/to/ca.crt",
  "cert_file": "/path/to/client.crt",
  "key_file": "/path/to/client.key",
  "max_version": "1.3",
  "min_version": "1.2",
  "enable_cluster": true,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 2000,
  "optimisation_max_active": 4000
}
```

##### Troubleshooting Redis Cluster

If you find that Tyk components fail to initialise when using Redis clustering, for example the application does not start and the last log file entry shows a message such as `Using clustered mode`, try setting the environment variable `REDIGOCLUSTER_SHARDCOUNT` to `128` on all hosts which connect to the Redis Cluster i.e. Gateway, Dashboard, Pump, MDCB. E.g.

`REDIGOCLUSTER_SHARDCOUNT=128`

If setting to `128` does not resolve the issue, try `256` instead.


### Configure Redis Sentinel

From v2.9.3 Redis Sentinel is supported.

Similar to Redis Cluster, our Gateway, Dashboard and Pump all support integration with Redis Sentinel.

To configure Tyk to work with Redis Sentinel, list your servers under `addrs` and set the master name in your Gateway, Dashboard, Pump and MDCB config. Unlike Redis Cluster, `enable_cluster` should **not** be set.  Indicative config snippets as follows:

#### Supported Versions
- Tyk 5.3 supports Redis 6.2.x, 7.0.x, and 7.2.x
- Tyk 5.2.x and earlier supports Redis 6.0.x and Redis 6.2.x only.


#### Redis Sentinel and Gateway

```json
"storage": {
  "type": "redis",
  "addrs": [
    "server1:26379",
    "server2:26379",
    "server3:26379"
  ],
  "master_name": "mymaster",
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 2000,
  "optimisation_max_active": 4000,
  "use_ssl": false
},
```

#### Redis Sentinel and Dashboard

```json
"redis_addrs": [
  "server1:26379",
  "server2:26379",
  "server3:26379"
],
"redis_master_name": "mymaster"
```

#### Redis Sentinel and Pump

```json
"analytics_storage_config": {
  "type": "redis",
  "addrs": [
    "server1:26379",
    "server2:26379",
    "server3:26379"
  ],
  "master_name": "mymaster",
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 100,
  "use_ssl": false
},
```

{{< warning success >}}
**Warning**

When using Bitnami charts to install Redis Sentinel in k8s, a Redis service is exposed, which means that standard Redis config is required instead of the above setup, i.e. a single server in `addrs` and `master_name` is not required.

{{< /warning >}}

#### Support for Redis Sentinel AUTH

To support the use of Redis Sentinel AUTH (introduced in Redis 5.0.1) we have added the following global config settings in Tyk v3.0.2:

* In the Tyk Gateway config file - `sentinel_password`
* In the Tyk Dashboard config file - `redis_sentinel_password`
* In the Tyk Pump config file - `sentinel_password`
* In the Tyk Identity Broker config file - `SentinelPassword`
* In the Tyk Synk config file - `sentinel_password`

These settings allow you to support Sentinel password-only authentication in Redis version 5.0.1 and above.

See the Redis and Sentinel authentication section of the [Redis Sentinel docs](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel) for more details.

#### Configure Redis TLS Encryption
Redis supports [SSL/TLS encryption](https://redis.io/topics/encryption) from version 6 as an optional feature, enhancing the security of data in transit. To configure TLS or mTLS connections between an application and Redis, consider the following settings in Tyk's configuration files:
