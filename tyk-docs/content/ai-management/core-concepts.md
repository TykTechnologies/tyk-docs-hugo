Welcome to Tyk AI Studio! Before diving into specific features, understanding these core concepts will help you navigate the platform and its capabilities.

## Key Components & Philosophy

Tyk AI Studio is designed as a secure, observable, and extensible gateway for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI services. Key architectural pillars include:

*   **[AI Gateway]({{< ref "ai-management/proxy" >}}):** The central gateway managing all interactions between your applications and various LLM providers. It enforces policies, logs activity, and handles vendor abstraction.
*   **AI Portal:** Empowers developers with a curated catalog of AI tools and services for faster innovation.
*   **[Chat]({{< ref "ai-management/chat-interface" >}}):** Provides a secure and interactive environment for users to engage with LLMs, leveraging integrated tools and data sources.
*   **[User Management & RBAC]({{< ref "ai-management/user-management" >}}):** Securely manages users, groups, and permissions. Access to resources like LLMs, Tools, and Data Sources is controlled via group memberships.
*   **Extensibility ([Tools]({{< ref "ai-management/tools" >}}) & [Data Sources]({{< ref "ai-management/datasources-rag" >}})):** Allows integrating external APIs (Tools) and vector databases (Data Sources) into LLM workflows (e.g., for Retrieval-Augmented Generation - RAG).
*   **Policy Enforcement ([Filters]({{< ref "ai-management/filters" >}})):** Intercept and modify LLM requests/responses using custom scripts to enforce specific rules or data transformations.
*   **Configuration over Code:** Many aspects like LLM parameters, Filters, and [Budgets]({{< ref "ai-management/budgeting" >}}) are configured through the UI/API rather than requiring code changes.
*   **Security First:** Features like [Secrets Management]({{< ref "ai-management/secrets" >}}), [SSO integration]({{< ref "ai-management/sso" >}}), and fine-grained access control are integral to the platform.
*   **Observability:** Includes systems for [Analytics & Monitoring]({{< ref "ai-management/analytics" >}}) and [Notifications]({{< ref "ai-management/notifications" >}}) to track usage, costs, and system events.

## Core Entities

Understanding these entities is crucial:

*   **[User]({{< ref "ai-management/user-management" >}}#core-concepts):** Represents an individual interacting with Tyk AI Studio, managed within the User Management system.
*   **[Group]({{< ref "ai-management/user-management" >}}#core-concepts):** Collections of users, the primary mechanism for assigning access rights to resources via RBAC.
*   **[API Key]({{< ref "ai-management/user-management" >}}#core-concepts):** Credentials generated by Users to allow applications or scripts programmatic access to Tyk AI Studio APIs (like the Proxy), inheriting the User's permissions.
*   **[LLM Configuration]({{< ref "ai-management/llm-management" >}}):** Represents a specific LLM provider and model setup (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude 3), including parameters and potentially associated [pricing]({{< ref "ai-management/llm-management" >}}#model-pricing-system) and [budgets]({{< ref "ai-management/budgeting" >}}).
*   **[Tool]({{< ref "ai-management/tools" >}}):** Definitions of external APIs (via OpenAPI spec) that can be invoked by LLMs during chat sessions to perform actions or retrieve external data.
*   **[Data Source]({{< ref "ai-management/datasources-rag" >}}):** Connections to vector databases or other data repositories used for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) within chat sessions.
*   **[Catalogue]({{< ref "ai-management/tools" >}}#catalogues-and-access-control) ([Tools]({{< ref "ai-management/tools" >}}#catalogues-and-access-control) / [Data Sources]({{< ref "ai-management/datasources-rag" >}}#catalogues-and-access-control)):** Collections that group related Tools or Data Sources for easier management and assignment to Groups for access control.
*   **[Secret]({{< ref "ai-management/secrets" >}}):** Securely stored credentials (API keys, tokens) referenced indirectly (e.g., `$SECRET/MY_KEY`) in configurations like LLMs, Tools, or Data Sources.
*   **[Filter]({{< ref "ai-management/filters" >}}):** Custom logic (using Tengo scripts) associated with specific execution points (e.g., pre/post LLM request) to intercept and modify requests/responses.
