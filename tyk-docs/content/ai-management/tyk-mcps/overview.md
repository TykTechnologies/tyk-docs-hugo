# Tyk Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers

## What are MCPs?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are a powerful way to extend the capabilities of AI systems by connecting them to external services, tools, and resources. MCP is a critical component in building a structured AI supply chain for enterprises, with both OpenAI and Google pledging support for this standard in their models and clients.

In the Tyk ecosystem, MCPs enable AI agents to:

- Access external data sources and APIs
- Execute specialized tools and functions
- Interact with system resources
- Retrieve contextual information

MCPs follow a standardized protocol that allows for seamless communication between AI agents and external systems, providing a structured way to expand what your AI applications can do while maintaining governance and control.

## How MCPs Work

MCPs operate as standalone servers that implement the Model Context Protocol. When an AI agent needs to perform a task that requires external resources or functionality, it can:

1. Connect to an MCP server
2. Request available tools and resources
3. Execute tools and access resources as needed
4. Process the results and continue its operations

The MCP acts as a bridge between the AI and the external world, handling authentication, resource access, and tool execution in a secure and controlled manner.

## Core Components of MCPs

### Tools

Tools are executable functions that an AI agent can use to perform specific tasks. Each tool has:

- A unique identifier
- An input schema defining required parameters
- A description of its functionality
- A function that performs the actual operation

Examples of tools include:

- Searching documentation
- Querying databases
- Calling external APIs
- Performing calculations
- Generating visualizations

### Resources

Resources represent data sources that an AI agent can access for context or information. Resources are identified by URIs and can include:

- Files and documents
- API responses
- Database records
- System information
- Configuration settings

## Getting Started with Tyk MCPs

### Setting Up an MCP Server

To set up an MCP server, you can use one of Tyk's pre-built MCP implementations or create your own custom server. Basic steps include:

1. Choose or create an MCP server implementation
2. Configure the server with the tools and resources you want to expose
3. Deploy the server so it's accessible to your AI applications
4. Connect your AI agents to the MCP server

### Available MCP Implementations

Tyk provides several MCP implementations that you can use or adapt:

- **[dashboard-mcp](/ai-management/tyk-mcps/dashboard-mcp)**: Connect to Tyk Dashboard API
- **[tyk-docs-mcp](/ai-management/tyk-mcps/tyk-docs-mcp)**: Search and retrieve information from documentation
- **[api-to-mcp](/ai-management/tyk-mcps/api-to-mcp)**: Convert existing APIs to MCP-compatible endpoints

### Configuring an MCP Server

MCP servers are configured with JSON files that define the available tools and resources. A typical configuration looks like:

```json
{
  "server_name": "example-mcp",
  "description": "Example MCP server with basic tools",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "search_docs",
      "description": "Search documentation for relevant information",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "query": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The search query"
          },
          "max_results": {
            "type": "number",
            "description": "Maximum number of results to return"
          }
        },
        "required": ["query"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "resources": {
    "documentation": {
      "description": "Access to documentation files",
      "uri_pattern": "docs://*"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using MCPs with Tyk AI Studio

MCPs integrate seamlessly with Tyk AI Studio, enhancing the capabilities of your AI applications. To use an MCP with AI Studio:

1. Deploy your MCP server
2. Register the MCP server with AI Studio
3. Configure access controls and permissions
4. Use the MCP tools and resources in your AI applications

This integration allows you to leverage both the governance and control features of AI Studio with the extensibility and flexibility of MCPs.

## Common Use Cases

### Documentation Search

Create an MCP that allows AI agents to search your organization's documentation, making it easier for them to provide accurate and contextual responses.

### API Integration

Build MCPs that connect to your internal APIs, allowing AI agents to retrieve data and perform operations within your systems.

### Custom Tool Development

Develop specialized tools for your industry or use case, such as financial calculators, medical diagnosis assistants, or engineering analysis tools.

### Content Generation

Implement MCPs that provide access to templates, brand guidelines, and content repositories to assist with content generation tasks.

## Best Practices

### Security

- Implement proper authentication and authorization for your MCP servers
- Validate and sanitize all inputs from AI agents
- Limit access to sensitive resources and tools
- Monitor and audit MCP usage

### Performance

- Optimize tool implementations for speed and efficiency
- Cache frequently accessed resources
- Implement rate limiting to prevent overload
- Monitor server performance and scale as needed

### Governance

- Document all tools and resources comprehensively
- Maintain version control for your MCP configurations
- Implement logging and auditing for compliance
- Establish clear ownership and maintenance responsibilities

## Advanced Topics

### Custom MCP Development

Learn how to develop custom MCP servers tailored to your specific needs, including:

- Creating custom tool implementations
- Integrating with proprietary systems
- Handling specialized authentication requirements
- Optimizing for specific use cases
