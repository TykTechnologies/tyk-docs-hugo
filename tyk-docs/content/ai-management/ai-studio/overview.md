**AI Management for Platform Teams**

We are excited to introduce our product for AI management - Tyk AI Studio

Tyk AI Studio enables platform teams to:
- Centralise access credentials to AI vendors, be that commercial offerings or in-house ones
- Log and measure how AI is being used internally
- Build and release Chatbots for internal Slack channels
- Ingest data into a knowledge corpus, with siloed access settings
- Build AI functions (Smart Functions) as a Service for common, single-task automations (e.g. summarise this article) or modulated pass-through to upstream AI’s with query inspection to provide context-aware access control.
- Script complex multi-modal assistants that can selectively determine which AI vendor, model, and data set to use depending on the nature of the user input
- Full-blown RBAC to democratise access to LLMs without impinging on security obligations

## MCP Integration

Tyk AI Studio seamlessly integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP), providing powerful capabilities for extending AI functionality:

- **Remote MCP catalogue & server support** - AI Studio exposes a remote MCP server, making it simple for enterprises to securely integrate their internal APIs and tools centrally, without relying on local workarounds.
  
- **Secure local MCP server generator** - For development or isolated environments, AI Studio includes an MCP generator that converts OpenAPI specs into locally installable MCP servers, proxied through the Tyk AI Gateway for observability and policy enforcement.

These MCP capabilities enable your organization to build a structured, secure AI supply chain while maintaining governance and control over how AI interacts with your systems.

## Key Features

## AI's promise vs. the reality:
Stellar efficiency, stumbling adoption

AI has transformed business operations, presenting significant potential when used effectively. However, [74% of companies](https://www.bcg.com/press/24october2024-ai-adoption-in-2024-74-of-companies-struggle-to-achieve-and-scale-value) struggle to fully realize its value. Despite the opportunities AI provides, it also introduces risks and challenges for CIOs and CTOs including:

* **Shadow AI**: Unauthorized tools running without oversight.
* **Data privacy and compliance**: Balancing innovation with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
* **Security and access control**: Maintaining robust authentication and role-based access.
* **Spiralling costs**: Unlimited AI consumption leading to high expenses due to uncontrolled token usage without rate limiting.

## Integrate AI with confidence and avoid chaos

Companies want to use AI, and when properly integrated and governed, it can drive huge revenue growth. But adopting AI must not outpace internal governance. It has to integrate with existing data services to enable innovation while maintaining strong governance. Your AI integration also needs to avoid compliance risks, support effective cost management and deliver a user-friendly developer experience.

**Trusted by global enterprises**
