Tyk Self-Managed consists of multiple components, as described above. While the OSS Gateway and Pump are available without a license, the remaining components require one. To experience the full capabilities of our Full Lifecycle API Management solution within your own infrastructure, please obtain a license by contacting our support team.

If you prefer guided support, we recommend exploring our [Tyk Technical PoC Guide](https://tyk.io/customer-engineering/poc/technical-guide/).

Once you have obtained your license, you can proceed with the installation options provided below.

## Tyk Demo 

Head over to our **Tyk Demo** guides in [Kubernetes]({{< ref "tyk-self-managed#kubernetes-demo" >}}) or [Docker]({{< ref "tyk-self-managed#docker-demo" >}}). These guides, with zero to none effort, will spin up the full Tyk infrastructure (Tyk stack) with examples of Tyk's capabilities and integrations out-of-the-box.
