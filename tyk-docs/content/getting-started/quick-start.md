At Tyk we understand that getting started with any tool can be overwhelming and time-consuming. This is the reason we created a few projects to give you a quick start in minutes - 

### For Tyk self-manged:
- Docker compose environment - [tyk-demo]({{<ref "getting-started/quick-start/tyk-demo.md" >}})
- Kubernetes environment - [tyk-k8s-demo]({{<ref "getting-started/quick-start/tyk-k8s-demo.md" >}})
The idea behind these projects is to provide an enriched environment with many integrations that can act as examples 
while demonstrating Tyk's capabilities.

### For Tyk open source:
Docker compose environment - [tyk-gateway-docker]("https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker")

All these open-source projects are actively being updated and improved. They are also being used daily by Tyk engineers. If you have questions or would like to request us to build a certain integration or to add a new example, please submit a request to each of the repos respectively.
