## Core API Management Capabilities

In this section, we will explore the core API management capabilities of Tyk Self-Managed using the pre-configured APIs.

<TODO: Add more details on the core API management capabilities that we will explore>

### API Security in Action

API security is an important aspect of API management. Tyk provides [multiple authentication methods]({{< ref "api-management/client-authentication/#what-does-tyk-support" >}}) to secure your APIs and control access. In this section, we'll explore the security features available in your trial environment.

#### Exploring Authentication Methods

Tyk supports various authentication methods including [Auth Token]({{< ref "api-management/authentication/bearer-token" >}}), [JWT]({{< ref "basic-config-and-security/security/authentication-authorization/json-web-tokens" >}}), [OAuth 2.0]({{< ref "api-management/authentication/oauth-2" >}}), and [more]({{< ref "api-management/client-authentication/#what-does-tyk-support" >}}). In your trial environment, the httpbingo API is pre-configured with Auth Token authentication.

**Understanding Auth Token Authentication:**

[Auth Token]({{< ref "api-management/authentication/bearer-token" >}}) is the simplest form of authentication. They're easy to implement and understand, making them perfect for your first exploration of Tyk.

1. **Create an API Key:**
   - In the Dashboard, navigate to the "Keys" section in the left menu
   - Click the "ADD KEY" button
   - Under "Access Rights," select the `HTTPBIN API Access` policy
   - Click "CREATE" to generate your API key
   <TODO: Add Image>
   - Copy the displayed API `key ID` for testing

2. **Test API Access with Your Key:**
   - Open a terminal or API client like Postman
   - Make a request to the API including your key in the Authorization header:
     ```
     curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/get
     ```
   - You should receive a successful response with details about your request

3. **Try Without Authentication:**
   - Make the same request without the Authorization header:
     ```
     curl http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/get
     or
     curl -H "Authorization: invalid-key" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/get
     ```
   - You should receive an "Unauthorized" error, confirming that authentication is working

**TODO: (Update this with JWT when API availalbe in Demo)**

**Exploring Other Authentication Methods (Optional):**

#### Rate Limiting and Quota Management

[Rate limiting]({{< ref "api-management/rate-limit" >}}) is a technique that allows you to control the rate at which clients can consume your APIs and is one of the fundamental aspects of managing traffic to your services. It serves as a safeguard against abuse, overloading, and denial-of-service attacks by limiting the rate at which an API can be accessed.

In this section we will implement and test rate limiting in Tyk.

**Understanding Rate Limiting:**

The trial includes two pre-configured policies with different rate limits:
- **Sandbox Plan**: 3 requests per 10 seconds (for testing rate limiting)
- **Production Plan**: 100 requests per 60 seconds (simulating a higher-tier plan)

**Testing Rate Limiting:**

1. **Create a Key with Rate Limiting:**
   - Go to the "Policies" section in the Dashboard
   - Note the "Sandbox Plan" policy that has a rate limit of 3 requests per 10 seconds
   - Go to the "Keys" section and create a new key
   - Assign the "Sandbox Plan" policy to this key
   - Save and copy the generated key
   <TODO: Add Image>

2. **Observe Rate Limiting in Action:**
   - Open a terminal and run multiple requests in quick succession:
     ```
     for i in {1..5}; do curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/get; echo -e "\n--- Request $i completed ---\n"; done
     ```
   - After the third request within 10 seconds, you should see a rate limit exceeded error
   - The error message will indicate that you've exceeded your rate limit and when you can try again

3. **Compare with a Higher Limit:**
   - Create another key with the "Production Plan" policy
   - Run the same test and observe that you can make more requests before hitting limits

**Understanding Quota Management:**

In addition to rate limiting, Tyk allows you to set quotas (total number of requests allowed in a time period). While not explicitly configured in the trial policies, you can explore this feature by modifying a policy and setting a quota limit.

#### Viewing Security Logs and Analytics

Tyk provides comprehensive logging and analytics for security monitoring and troubleshooting.

**Accessing Security Logs:**

1. **View API Request Logs:**
   - In the Dashboard, go to the "Activity" section in the left menu
   - Here you'll see a log of all API requests, including:
     - Success/failure status
     - Authentication details
     - IP addresses
     - Timestamps
     - Response times

2. **Filter Security Events:**
   - Use the filters at the top to focus on security-related events
   - Filter by error type to see authentication failures
   - Filter by API to focus on a specific service

3. **Examine Rate Limiting Events:**
   - After testing rate limiting, filter the logs to show "Rate Limit" errors
   - Examine the details of these events to understand how rate limiting is enforced

**Exploring Analytics for Security Insights:**

1. **Access the Analytics Dashboard:**
   - Go to the "Dashboard" section under Analytics
   - View the overview of API usage, errors, and performance

2. **Security-Focused Analytics:**
   - Look for the "Errors" widget to identify authentication and authorization issues

   - Use the time range selector to analyze trends over different periods

3. **Generate a Security Report:**
   - Use the "Generate Report" feature to create a security-focused report
   - Select metrics related to authentication and rate limiting
   - Export the report for sharing with your team

**Key Security Takeaways:**

- Tyk provides multiple layers of security: authentication, rate limiting, and quotas
- Real-time logs and analytics help you monitor and respond to security events
- Policies allow you to create different security tiers for different API consumers
- The Dashboard makes it easy to visualize security patterns and identify issues

By exploring these security features, you'll gain a solid understanding of how Tyk helps protect your APIs while providing the right level of access to authorized consumers.


### Traffic Control & Transformation

Tyk API [Gateway]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway" >}}) can control and transform incoming API traffic. It provides [various mechanisms]({{< ref "api-management/traffic-transformation" >}}) to modify requests and responses, control traffic flow, and optimize performance. Let's explore these capabilities in your trial environment.

#### Testing Request/Response Transformations

Transformations allow you to modify API requests and responses without changing your backend services. This is useful for adapting legacy APIs, standardizing formats, or enhancing responses.

**Understanding Transformations:**

The httpbingo API in your trial includes a pre-configured transformation on the `/xml` endpoint that converts XML responses to JSON format.

**Testing the XML to JSON Transformation:**

1. **Make a Request to the XML Endpoint:**
   - Using your API key from the previous section, make a request to the XML endpoint:
     ```
     curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/xml
     ```
   - Notice that even though the backend returns XML, you receive a JSON response
   - This transformation happens in the gateway, not in the backend service

2. **Examine the Transformation Configuration:**
   - In the Dashboard, go to the "APIs" section
   - Click on the httpbingo API
   - Navigate to the "Endpoint Designer" tab
   - Find the `/xml` path and click on it
   - You'll see the response transformation that converts XML to JSON

Transformations are a powerful way to adapt APIs to your needs without modifying backend code, making them ideal for modernizing legacy services or standardizing API responses across different systems.

#### Exploring Caching Configurations

Caching improves API performance by storing responses and serving them without hitting your backend services for every request. This reduces latency and backend load.

**Understanding API Caching:**

The httpbingo API includes a caching example on the `/test` endpoint with a 10-second cache lifetime. This means that repeated requests within 10 seconds will receive the same cached response.

**Testing Caching Behavior:**

1. **Make an Initial Request:**
   - Using your API key, make a request to the test endpoint:
     ```
     curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/test
     ```
   - Take note of the value in the "Postman-Token" field in the response

2. **Make an Immediate Second Request:**
   - Immediately make another request to the same endpoint:
     ```
     curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/test
     ```
   - Notice that the "Postman-Token" value is identical to the first request
   - This confirms that you're receiving a cached response, not a new one from the backend

3. **Wait and Test Again:**
   - Wait 11 seconds (just past the 10-second cache lifetime)
   - Make another request to the same endpoint
   - You should see a different "Postman-Token" value, indicating a fresh response from the backend

4. **Examining Cache Configuration:**

    1. In the Dashboard, go to the "APIs" section
    2. Click on the httpbingo API
    3. Navigate to the "Advanced Options" tab
    4. Look for the "Cache Response" section to see how caching is configured

Caching is particularly valuable for responses that are expensive to generate but don't change frequently. By implementing appropriate caching strategies, you can significantly improve API performance and reduce backend load.

### API Monitoring & Analytics

Understanding how your APIs are used is crucial for maintaining performance, planning capacity, and ensuring security. Tyk provides comprehensive analytics and monitoring tools to give you visibility into your API traffic.

#### Generating Test Traffic

To explore Tyk's analytics capabilities, you'll need to generate some API traffic. This simulates real-world usage patterns and populates the analytics dashboard.

**Creating Test Traffic:**

1. **Using Command Line Tools:**
   - You can use simple bash loops to generate multiple requests:
     ```
     for i in {1..20}; do curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/get; sleep 0.5; done
     ```
   - This sends 20 requests with a half-second delay between each

2. **Using Apache Bench (if installed):**
   - For more controlled load testing:
     ```
     ab -n 100 -c 10 -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/get
     ```
   - This sends 100 requests with 10 concurrent connections

3. **Generating Diverse Traffic:**
   - Try accessing different endpoints to create a more realistic traffic pattern:
     ```
     curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/headers
     curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/ip
     curl -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" http://localhost:8080/httpbingo/user-agent
     ```
   - Include some errors by attempting to exceed rate limits or access without authentication

#### Exploring Real-time Analytics

Once you've generated some traffic, you can explore Tyk's analytics capabilities to gain insights into API usage.

**Accessing Analytics Dashboard:**

1. **View the Main Dashboard:**
   - In the Tyk Dashboard, go to the "Dashboard" section under "Analytics"
   - This provides an overview of API usage, errors, and performance metrics
   - The dashboard updates in near real-time as new requests are processed

2. **Explore Key Metrics:**
   - **Request Volume**: See how many requests are being processed
   - **Error Rates**: Monitor authentication failures and other errors
   - **Response Times**: Track API performance and identify slow endpoints
   - **Geographic Distribution**: See where API requests are coming from

3. **Drill Down into Specific APIs:**
   - Click on the httpbingo API in the analytics view
   - This shows detailed metrics specific to that API
   - You can see which endpoints are most frequently used
   - Identify any performance or error hotspots

**Using Analytics for Decision Making:**

The analytics dashboard helps you answer important questions about your APIs:

- Which endpoints are most popular?
- Are there performance bottlenecks?
- Are users experiencing errors?
- How is usage changing over time?

These insights can guide your API development priorities, capacity planning, and troubleshooting efforts.

**Exporting Analytics Data (Optional):**

If you want to perform more detailed analysis or integrate with other systems:

1. Use the "Export" button in the analytics dashboard
2. Select your preferred format (CSV, JSON)
3. Choose the time range and metrics to export
4. Use the exported data with your preferred analysis tools
