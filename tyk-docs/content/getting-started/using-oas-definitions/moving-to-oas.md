Moving to Tyk OAS APIs can help you save time, reduce risks of error and streamline your workflows. Sounds great right? So should all your APIs be OAS based now? 

The answer is: possibly. The key question is whether there is anything you currently use in your Tyk Classic APIs that isn’t yet supported by our Tyk OAS APIs. Tyk OAS API support is currently in [Early Access]({{< ref "/frequently-asked-questions/using-early-access-features" >}}) and some Tyk features are not yet supported. You can see the status of what is and isn't yet supported [here]({{< ref "/getting-started/using-oas-definitions/oas-reference" >}}).

Getting going is pretty straight forward, just jump in here and we’ll get you started: [High Level Concepts]({{< ref "/content/getting-started/key-concepts/high-level-concepts.md" >}}).
