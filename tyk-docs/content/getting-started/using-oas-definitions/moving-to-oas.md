Moving to Tyk OAS API definitions can help you save time, reduce risks of error and streamline your workflows. Sounds great right? So should all your APIs be OAS based now? 

The answer is; possibly. The key question is whether there is anything you currently use in Tyk APIs that isn’t yet supported by our Tyk OAS definitions. See our [OAS reference page]({{< ref "/content/getting-started/using-oas-definitions/oas-reference.md" >}}) for more details of what we currently support.

Getting going is pretty straight forward, just jump in here and we’ll get you started: [High Level Concepts]({{< ref "/content/getting-started/key-concepts/high-level-concepts.md" >}}).
