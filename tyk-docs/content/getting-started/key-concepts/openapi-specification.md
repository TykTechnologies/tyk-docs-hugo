Tyk has always had a proprietary specification for defining APIs. From Tyk v4.1 Tyk has supported API definitions that embed the [OpenAPI Specification v3.0.x](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3) (OAS) format, which can offer significant time and complexity savings if you are already using it to design and document your APIs.

If you canâ€™t wait to get started, head on over to our [guide]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/high-level-concepts" >}}) to using OAS API Definitions for some tutorials.

### What does a Tyk OAS API Definition look like?

As part of a Tyk OAS Definition, there are a number of vendor specific fields that need to be configured. These fall into these categories:

- Info - information about your New API; its name and whether it should be active for example
- Upstream - where should Tyk forward requests to?
- Server - what URL should users be using to call the API served by the Tyk Gateway.

You can also optionally define:

- Middleware - add additional logic to your API flow, for example allow/block lists or request/response validation.
- [Servers]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/servers" >}}) - find out how Tyk integrates neatly between your clients and upstream services, automatically configuring where it will proxy requests
- [Authentication]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/authentication" >}}) - with Tyk's OpenAPI implementation you have the option of delegating authentication to the upstream service, or handling it on the Tyk Gateway
- [Mock Responses]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/mock-response-middleware" >}}) - Tyk can automatically configure mock response middleware using the configuration included in your OAS document; this allows you to test your APIs without connecting to the upstream services
- [Request Validation]({{< ref "product-stack/tyk-gateway/middleware/validate-request-middleware" >}})  - Tyk can protect your APIs by automatically validating the request parameters and payload against a schema that defines what it *should* look like
- [Paths]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/paths" >}}) - this is a section within the OAS definition that instructs Tyk which API paths (also referred to as endpoints) should be configured; Tyk uses this information to determine which middleware should be enabled for each
- [Versioning]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/oas-versioning" >}}) - API versioning, a crucial API gateway capability, allows you to update and improve your APIs without breaking existing clients or services
