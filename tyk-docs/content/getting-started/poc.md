At Tyk we understand that getting started with any tool can be overwhelming and time-consuming. This is why we built 
the [tyk-demo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-demo) and [tyk-k8s-demo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s-demo) 
repositories. The idea is to provide an enriched environment with many integrations that can act as integration examples 
as well as demonstrate Tyk's capabilities.

These libraries are constantly being improved and are used by the Tyk engineers, if you have any questions or would like to 
request an example of an specific integration or feature example you can submit a request to each of the repos respectively. 

Docker compose environment (tyk-demo)
Kubernetes environment (tyk-k8s-demo)
