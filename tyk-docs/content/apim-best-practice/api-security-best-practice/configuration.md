Modern APIs are often backed by large technology stacks composed of numerous components and libraries. Each of these is a potential weak link in the security chain, so efforts must be made to ensure that security measures are implemented throughout. The API gateway plays a critical part in an overall security strategy, by utilising its ability to process requests in a secure manner.

### Secure Connections

Use [transport layer security]({{< ref "basic-config-and-security/security/tls-and-ssl" >}}) where possible. Most importantly, on inbound connections to the gateway and outbound connection from the gateway to the upstream API and other services. TLS can also be used as a form of authentication, using [Mutual TLS]({{< ref "basic-config-and-security/security/mutual-tls" >}}).

### Limit Functionality

Use [security policies]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/what-is-a-security-policy" >}}) to specify which paths, methods and schemas are accessible, whilst blocking all others.

### Mitigate Server-Side Request Forgery

Restrict any URL-based input data to specific schemas, hosts and paths by using [schema validation]({{< ref "graphql/validation#schema-validation" >}}). When data is fetched server-side, it should be validated and not returned to the client in raw format.

### Protect Secrets

Prevent sensitive data, such as usernames, passwords, licence keys and other secrets, from being stored as plain text in application configuration files. Use [key value secret storage]({{< ref "tyk-configuration-reference/kv-store" >}}) to dynamically load sensitive data from a secure secret manager.

### Sanitise Responses

Modify or remove sensitive data from responses by using [transforms]({{< ref "advanced-configuration/transform-traffic" >}}) to alter the [response headers]({{< ref "advanced-configuration/transform-traffic/response-headers" >}}) and [body]({{< ref "advanced-configuration/transform-traffic/response-body" >}}).
