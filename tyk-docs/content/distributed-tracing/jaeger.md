Jaeger is a distributed tracing system. It is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems. To lean more about jaeger [visit their website](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)


To enable this tracer, you need to have a working jaeger server.

## Configuring

In `tyk.conf` on `tracing` setting

```{.json}
{
  "tracing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "name": "jaeger",
    "options": {}
  }
}
```

`options` are settings that are used to initialize the jaeger client. For more details about the options [see client libraries](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.11/client-libraries/)
