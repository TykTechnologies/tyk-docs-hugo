## What is Tyk On-Premises / Self-Managed ?

Tyk Self-Managed is the way to install our Full Lifecycle API Management solution in your own infrastructure.  There is no calling home, and there are no usage limits.  You have full control.

## Installing Tyk Self-Managed:
Please visit our [Self-Managed installation](/docs/tyk-self-managed/install/) page to get started.

## Licencing

Read more about licensing [here](/docs/tyk-on-premises/licensing).

## Tyk Components
The full Tyk Self-Managed system consists of:
<!-- todo: oss labels: -->
* [Tyk Gateway](/docs/getting-started/tyk-components/gateway/):  The API Gateway that proxies and manages your traffic.
* [Tyk Dashboard](/docs/getting-started/tyk-components/dashboard/): The management Dashboard and integration API for managing a cluster of Tyk Gateways, also shows analytics and features the [Developer portal](/docs/tyk-developer-portal).
* [Tyk Pump](/docs/tyk-pump): Handles moving analytics data between your gateways and your Dashboard (amongst other data sinks).
* [Tyk Identity Broker](/docs/tyk-identity-broker/) (Optional): Handles integrations with third-party IDP's.
* [Tyk Multi-Data Center Bridge](/docs/tyk-multi-data-centre/) (Optional, add-on): Allows for the configuration of a Tyk ecosystem that spans many data centers and clouds.

## Dependencies & Database Support

### Tyk Dashboard

By default the Tyk Dashboard uses MongoDB. You can use the following as a drop-in replacement:

* [DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/)
<!-- * [Azure Cosmos DB version 3.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-feature-support) -->
* MongoDB 3.x and 4.0.x

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

If you are using DocumentDB, [capped collections](/docs/analytics-and-reporting/capping-analytics-data-storage/) are not supported. See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/mongo-apis.html) for more details.

### Tyk Gateway

Visit the [Gateway page](/docs/tyk-oss-gateway/) for more info.

- Redis 2.8.x to 5.0.x

## Init Systems

Tyk packages support [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/), [Upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/) (both 0.6.x and 1.x) and SysVinit Linux init systems. During package installation only one is chosen depending on the operating system support, e.g.:

*   CentOS 6, RHEL 6, Amazon Linux ship with Upstart 0.6.x
*   Ubuntu 14.04, Debian Jessie with Upstart 1.x
*   CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Ubuntu 16.04, Debian Stretch are running with systemd
*   Certain older distros may only provide SysVinit but all of them typically provide compatibility with its scripts

Note that any init scripts of your choosing can be used instead of automatically detected ones by copying them from the `install/inits` directory inside the package directory.

This init system variance implies there are different ways to manage the services and collect service logs.

#### Upstart
For Upstart, service management can be performed through the `initctl` or a set of `start`, `stop`, `restart` and `status` commands. Upstart 1.x also works with the `service` command.

#### systemd 
For systemd, either `systemctl` or `service` commands may be utilised.

The `service` command can usually be used with SysVinit scripts, as well as invoking them directly.

## Service logs availability ##

*   Upstart 0.6.x and SysVinit: log files are located in `/var/logs` for every respective service, e.g. `/var/logs/tyk-gateway.stderr` and `/var/logs/tyk-gateway.stdout`
*   Upstart 1.x: by default everything is stored in `/var/logs/upstart` directory, e.g. `/var/logs/upstart/tyk-gateway.log`
*   systemd utilises its own logging mechanism called journald, which is usable via the `journalctl` command, e.g. `journalctl -u tyk-gateway`


Please consult with respective init system documentation for more details on how to use and configure it.
