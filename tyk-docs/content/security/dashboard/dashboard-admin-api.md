## What is the Dashboard Admin API ?

The Dashboard Admin API provides functions for:

* Creating an Organisation
* Modifying an Organisation
* Creating a User

These functions are designed to bootstrap a new API Dashboard installation with a base organisation and a base User for that organisation.

This API should not be used for anything else except for the above purposes.

The Admin API is secured using a shared secret, this secret is set in the `tyk_analytics.conf` file.

The Admin API requires a header called admin-auth to be included to differentiate the call from a regular API call.
