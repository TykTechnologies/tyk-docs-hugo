In some cases you may want to compose multiple API calls or multiple APIs into a bundled or batched request. This is possible with Tyk and can be easily achieved using our [Virtual Endpoint](https://tyk.io/docs/compose-apis/virtual-endpoints/) and [Batch Request](ent https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-rest-api/batch-requests/) features.
