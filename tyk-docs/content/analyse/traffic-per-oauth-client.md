Traffic statistics are available on a per OAuth Client ID basis if you are using the OAuth mode for one of your APIs. To get a breakdown view of traffic aggregated to a Client ID, you will need to go to the *System Management -> APIs* section and then under the *OAuth API*, there will be a button called *OAuth API*. Selecting an OAuth client will then show its aggregate activity

![OAuth Client][1]


In the API list view â€“ an *OAuth Clients* button will appear for OAuth enabled APIs, use this to browse to the Client ID and the associated analytics for that client ID:

![OAuth Client Analytics Data][2]

You can view the analytics of individual tokens generated by this Client ID in the regular token view.
