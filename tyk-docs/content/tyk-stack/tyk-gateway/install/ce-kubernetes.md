We will cover the installation file using Kubernetes deployment files, but you can also use our Kubernetes [Helm Chart](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-helm-chart).

### Installation 

See our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-oss-k8s-deployment) in order to install Tyk on Kubernetes.  


### Tyk Operator
Don't forget to combine your Tyk Gateway with the [Tyk Operator](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator) in order to get Kubernetes native, GitOps designed workflows using custom CRDs.
