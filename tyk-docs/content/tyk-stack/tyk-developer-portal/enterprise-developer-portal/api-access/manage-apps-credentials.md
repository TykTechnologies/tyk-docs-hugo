## Introduction

- A portal admin app login

2. Click on an app from the overview page.
3. On the right hand slideout, you will see the information about the created app.

### Revoke app credentials

1. In the portal admin app, go to **Apps** and open the app.
2. Click **credentials**. This means the developer will no longer be able to access the API Product via the selected plan. These actions will have an immediate effect.
