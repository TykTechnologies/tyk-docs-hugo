## Prerequisites

- A Tyk Enterprise portal installation
- A portal admin app login
- A login to the already created app by an external API consumer

## To view existing apps

1. In the portal admin app, go to **Apps**. If there are some apps already created by external API-consumers, youâ€™ll see them in the overview list.

**Screenshot needed**

2. Click on an app from the overview page.
3. On the right hand slideout, you will see the information about the created app.

## Revoke app credentials

1. In the portal admin app, go to **Apps** and open the app.
2. Click **credentials**. This means the developer will no longer be able to access the API Product via the selected plan. These actions will have an immediate effect.
