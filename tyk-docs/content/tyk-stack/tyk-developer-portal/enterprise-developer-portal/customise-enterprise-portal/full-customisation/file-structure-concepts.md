**This version of our Portal is in Beta**

This documentation is for the new Tyk Enterprise Portal currently in private beta. If you are interested in getting access contact us at [support@tyk.io](<mailto:support@tyk.io?subject=Tyk Enterprise Portal Beta>)

## Developer portal themes

The Developer Portal uses themes for customising the live portal.
We provide an out of the box theme that is using our own branding, it’s called the ‘default’ theme. You are welcome to use it and modify it for your needs, yet if you want to start with a blank page, you can also create a completely new theme.

The following page explains how they are structured and the main concepts. We recommend you read this if you are creating your own theme, or making extensive changes to the ones we provide.

## Theming

Generally speaking a theme defines an application’s styling, templates and scripts.
In the Tyk Developer Portal a “themes” folder is located in the root of the application and is the directory where each theme folder must be added. If you navigate to `path /themes/` you’ll see our default theme which has the following structure:

{{< img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/theme-file-structure.png" alt="Default Tyk Enterprise Portal theme structure" >}}

- Manifest file (`theme.json`): uses JSON syntax to define theme metadata (name, version and author) as well as a list of templates that are part of the theme.
- `assets`: intended for static assets like CSS, JS or images that are used by the theme. All contents from this directory are mounted under the `/assets` path in the portal HTTP server.
- `layouts`: the layout is the top level view of your theme.
- `views`: the view is rendered as part of a layout. Each view can be rendered using a different layout.
- `partials`: partials provide an easier way to handle snippets of code that are reused across different views or layouts, for example if you want to inject a JS snippet that’s used in different places, you could set this code in a partial and include it anywhere by using the appropriate Go template directive. In this way you could improve code readability and organise the theme in the most efficient way.

### Manifest file

This file should sit in the root of a theme and it holds the theme's configuration. You can define a name, your templates along other options such as the version and the author.
You can find an example of the manifest within the “default” theme that is located in /themes/default and the syntax looks as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "default",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "author": "Tyk Technologies Ltd. <hello@tyk.io>",
  "templates": [
      {
        "name": "Content Page",
        "template": "page",
        "layout": "site_layout"
      },
      {
        "name": "Portal Home",
        "template": "portal_home",
        "layout": "portal_layout"
      },
      {
        "name": "Home",
        "template": "home",
        "layout": "portal_layout"
      },
      {
        "name": "Catalogue",
        "template": "catalogue",
        "layout": "portal_layout"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `templates` field establishes a list of available templates. Every template consists of three fields where `name` is a user-friendly name that will be seen on the Admin app when creating a page, `template` is a reference to the template file itself and `layout` is a reference to the layout that will be used to render the previously set template.

In order to illustrate the current template hierarchy, this is what a typically rendered page would look like. The `layout` would be the top level template and base structure of the page:
{{< img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/portal-template-layout.png" alt="Template structure" >}}



Also note that the Developer Portal will let you use not just multiple `layouts` and `views` but also any combination of these two. These combinations are set in your manifest file (`theme.json`).

Regarding `partials`, even though the illustration above shows two partials embedded on the `view` section, `partials` are intended for use in any place. You should be able to embed a `partial` directly into a layout, or even in multiple layouts.

Content blocks are explored more deeply in the next sections. To summarise its relationship with the above hierarchy: when rendering a particular page, a `layout`, a `view` and potentially a combination of partials get loaded from the theme directory. Content blocks are different because their content gets dynamically populated by database content, these contents are created from the Admin section.

To Conclude:

- A layout is the wrapper of everything you want to include inside it, so typically it would consist of tags such as `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`.
- A `template` is what we would inject in a layout and specifically within the `<body>` of a layout.
- A `partial` can be, for example the navigation menu so that you can inject it in the layout and it will be visible every time this layout is used

### Go templates

All theme template files use the Go template syntax, you will find that every file in the layouts, views and partials directory uses the `.tmpl` file extension, which is the default Go template extension. Go templates work in a similar way to ERB or EJS templates by allowing the user to mix HTML code with dynamic values. Sample syntax is as follows:

`{{ render “top_nav” }}`

The code sample above would execute the `render` template helper, which is a common function that’s used to inject code from other `views` into the current one. You may use this to embed content from other parts of the theme, typically `partials` or `views`. In this case it will insert a `view` or `partial` named `top_nav` to the template where it’s used.

The same delimiters `{{` and `}}` are used for all Go template directives. We’ll explore some of them in the upcoming sections.

See the [Go package template documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#pkg-overview) for more information.

### Content blocks

The Developer Portal themes use content blocks to facilitate content management. A content block is defined as part of a `view` by using a particular template directive in combination with a name or ID to identify the given block. For example if you check the `home` template in the default theme (`themes/default/views/home.tmpl`), you will find the following code:

```go
div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <div class="text-container">
        <h1>{{.page.Title}}</h1>
        <p>{{.blocks.HeaderDescription.Content}}</p>
        <a href="{{.blocks.HeaderButtonLink.Content}}" class="btn btn-primary">{{.blocks.HeaderButtonLabel.Content}}</a>
    </div>
….
```
There are four code references in the above snippet. In this example we have a header, some text and then a button that acts as a link, so let's see what each one is and how it correlates with the UI.

1. `{{ .page.Title }}`. This is the `Title` input in the form UI (Screenshot #1)
1. `{{ .blocks.HeaderDescription.Content }}`. This is the `HeaderDescription` input in the form UI (Screenshot #2)
2. `{{ .blocks.HeaderButtonLink.Content }}`. This is the `HeaderDescription` input in the form UI (Screenshot #3)
3. `{{ .blocks.HeaderButtonLabel.Content }}`. This is the `HeaderButtonLabel` input in the form UI (Screenshot #4)

{{< img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/go-template-ui.png" alt="Go template blocks and portal UI" >}}

This will display as follows in your portal:

{{< img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/example-portal-content-block.png" alt="Example Portal content block" >}}

In order for a page to render properly the content manager will need to be aware of the content blocks that are required by a particular template.
