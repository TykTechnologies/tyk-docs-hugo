To get started with the Enterprise Developer portal you need to accomplish three steps:

1. Connect to a prodvider (Tyk Self Managed).
2. Create and import API Products and Plans in your Tyk Self Managed Instance.	
3. Publish API Products and Plans to the Developer portal so that API consumers can access them.
