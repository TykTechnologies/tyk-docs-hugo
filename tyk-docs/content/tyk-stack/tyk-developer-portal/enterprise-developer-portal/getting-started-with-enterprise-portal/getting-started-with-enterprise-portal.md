**This version of our Portal is in Beta**

This documentation is for the new Tyk Enterprise Portal currently in private beta. If you are interested in getting access contact us at [support@tyk.io](<mailto:support@tyk.io?subject=Tyk Enterprise Portal Beta>)

{{< /note >}}


To get started with the Enterprise Developer portal you need to accomplish three steps:

1. Connect to an API prodvider. For now we support only Tyk Pro, but more are to come!
2. Create policies for API Products and plans in your instance of Tyk Pro.
3. Import your API Products and plans from your Tyk Pro instance into the  portal and publish them into appropriate catalogues.
