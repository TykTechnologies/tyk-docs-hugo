## Introduction

This guide explains how to migrate resources such as API products, plans, tutorials, and content blocks between environments in the Tyk Developer Portal. With the introduction of **Custom IDs (CIDs)** in Tyk Portal 1.13, certain resources now have a **persistent identifier** that remains fixed regardless of environment or (re)creation. Unlike traditional IDs (IDs), which may change when resources are migrated or recreated, CIDs provide a stable and reliable reference point, enabling seamless resource management and consistent relationships across environments.

Before Portal 1.13, we relied solely on identifiers generated by the database (DB) for resources. These IDs worked well until we needed to synchronise, migrate, or recreate/restore resources across different instances of the portal. When a resource like an API product or a user was recreated or restored, it would be assigned a new ID, which would break relationships with other resources. For example, if an API product was linked to a plan, that link would no longer be valid after the product was recreated with a new ID.

To solve this problem, we introduced Custom IDs (CIDs) in Tyk Portal 1.13. CIDs are persistent identifiers that stay the same, even when a resource is recreated or restored. This ensures that resources can maintain their identity and relationships—like linking API products to plans or users to teams—without worrying about changing IDs.

By using CIDs, we can now sync, migrate, and restore resources across instances reliably, ensuring relationships stay intact and references remain valid, even when resources are recreated or restored.

The following resources now support Custom IDs (CIDs):

- OAuth Providers and Client Types
- Products, Plans, Tutorials, and OAS Documents
- Organisations and Teams
- Pages and Content Blocks

These resources are now easily transferable between environments, with their relationships preserved via CIDs, ensuring smooth migrations and consistent management.

### Automatic CID Assignment

When upgrading to Tyk Portal 1.13 from an earlier version, the portal automatically runs a **background process** to assign CIDs to resources created in previous versions. This process also runs every time the portal starts, ensuring any new resources without CIDs are retroactively assigned one, whether after an upgrade or a fresh installation.

**Please note**: It may take a while for all resources to receive their CIDs after an upgrade. We appreciate your patience during this process.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure the following are true:

- Your Tyk Developer Portal version is 1.13 or later.
- All resources in your source environment have **Custom IDs** (CIDs) assigned. Resources created after version 1.13 automatically include a CID, while resources from earlier versions receive CIDs through the portal's startup process.
- You have admin access to both the source and target environments.


## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Source Environment

1. Log in to the source Tyk Developer Portal.
2. Identify the resources you want to migrate (e.g., API products, plans, OAuth providers).
3. Make sure each resource has a **Custom ID (CID)**:
   - Resources created in Portal 1.13 or later automatically include a CID.
   - Resources created before 1.13 will have been assigned CIDs during the portal's startup process.
4. Verify that there are no duplicate CIDs for the resources.


### 2. Dumping Resources

To migrate resources, you first need to **dump** (or export) them from your source environment. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Fetch the Resources**: The script will automatically pull resources (like organisations and teams) from the source portal. It does this in pages to handle large numbers of resources without overwhelming the system.
2. **Export and Save**: The resources will be saved in separate files with the Custom ID (CID) included. This ensures that each resource is uniquely identified and can be easily restored in the target environment.
3. **Pagination**: Since the portal may have many resources, the script handles the pagination automatically. It will continue to fetch resources from additional pages until everything is exported.

The script to export resources is shown below. You just need to run it, and it will handle the fetching, exporting, and saving automatically.

### 3. Restoring Resources

After exporting the resources, the next step is to restore them into the target environment. The process for restoring resources involves:

1. **Cleaning up the data**: Before restoring resources, some fields need to be removed to prevent conflicts or issues during the restore process. For example:
   - For organisations, remove `.ID`, `.CreatedAt`, `.UpdatedAt`, and `.Teams`
   - For teams, remove `.Users`

2. **Use Custom IDs for Restore**: During the restore process, you must use the Custom ID (CID) to ensure the relationships are maintained. The target environment will either update existing resources with matching CIDs or create new ones.

3. **Restore the resources**: Finally, post the data to the target environment using the POST method (instead of PUT, which would update existing resources).

### 4. Sample Script for Organisations and Teams

Here's a sample script that shows how to export and restore **organisations** and **teams**. You can modify it to work for other resources as needed.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# A script to export and restore organisations and teams between environments in Tyk Developer Portal.

set -euo pipefail

# Variables from environment or command-line flags
