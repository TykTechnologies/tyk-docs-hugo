Traffic analytics are captured by the Gateway nodes and then temporarily stored in Redis.  The Tyk Pump is responsible for moving those analytics into a persistent data store, such as MongoDB, where the traffic can be analyzed.

## What is the Tyk Pump?

The Tyk Pump is our [open source](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-pump) analytics purger that moves the data generated by your Tyk nodes to any back-end. It is primarily used to display your analytics data in the Tyk Dashboard.

The Tyk Pump is not currently configurable in our Tyk Cloud solution.
