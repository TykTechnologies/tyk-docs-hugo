Tyk comes with support for OpenID Connect provided by any standards compliant OIDC provider.

Getting OIDC support in the Dashboard requires only JWT auth to be set up in the Core settings tab. For details see [JSON Web Tokens]({{< ref "basic-config-and-security/security/authentication-authorization/json-web-tokens" >}}).
