- `OrgRateLimitExceeded`: the rate limit has been exceeded for a specific organisation
- `RateLimitSmoothingUp`: the [intermediate rate limit allowance]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#rate-limit-smoothing" >}}) has been increased for a specific key
- `RateLimitSmoothingDown`: the [intermediate rate limit allowance]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/rate-limiting#rate-limit-smoothing" >}}) has been decreased for a specific key

### Standard quota events

### Circuit breaker events
