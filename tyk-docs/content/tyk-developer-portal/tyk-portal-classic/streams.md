As of Tyk v5.7.0, you can now publish Tyk Streams APIs to the Tyk Developer Portal.

## How To Set Up

Simply create a [Tyk Streams API]({{< ref "api-management/event-driven-apis#create-a-streams-api" >}}), create a [Policy]({{< ref "api-management/gateway-config-managing-classic#create-a-security-policy-with-the-dashboard" >}}) which protects it, and then [publish it to the Developer Portal Catalog]({{< ref "portal/overview#publish-an-api-product" >}}).
