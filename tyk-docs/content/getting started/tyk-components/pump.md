## What is the Tyk Pump?

The Tyk Pump is our [open source](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-pump) analytics purger that moves the data generated by your Tyk nodes to any back-end. It is primarily used to display your analytics data in the Tyk Dashboard.

### Other Supported Backend Services

The following services can be configured in your `pump.conf` file:

* MongoDB (to replace built-in purging)
* CSV
* ElasticSearch (2.0+)
* Graylog
* InfluxDB
* Moesif
* Splunk
* StatsD
* DogStatsD
* Hybrid (Tyk RPC)
* Prometheus
* Logz.io

See [Tyk Pump Configuration](/docs/configure/tyk-pump-configuration/) for more details.

Tyk Pump can be horizontally scaled without causing duplicate data.
