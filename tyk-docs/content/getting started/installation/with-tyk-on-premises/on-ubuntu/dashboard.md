## <a name="install-tyk-dashboard-ubuntu"></a>Install Tyk Dashboard on Ubuntu

Tyk has its own APT repositories hosted by the kind folks at [packagecloud.io][1], which makes it easy, safe and secure to install a trusted distribution of the Tyk Gateway stack.

This tutorial has been tested on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS operating system. It should also work with Ubuntu 16.04 & 18.04 with few if any modifications. We will install Tyk Dashboard with all dependencies locally.

### Prerequisites

*   Have MongoDb and Redis installed - see [here][2] for details.
*   Ensure port `3000` is available. This is used by the Dashboard to provide the GUI and the Developer Portal. 

### Step 1: Set up our APT Repositories

First, add our GPG key which signs our binaries:
```{.copyWrapper}
curl -L https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-dashboard/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
```

Run update:
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo apt-get update
```

Since our repositories are installed via HTTPS, you will need to make sure APT supports this:
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https 
```

Now lets add the required repos and update again (notice the `-a` flag in the second Tyk commands - this is important!):
```{.copyWrapper}
echo "deb https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-dashboard/ubuntu/ trusty main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tyk_tyk-dashboard.list

echo "deb-src https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-dashboard/ubuntu/ trusty main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tyk_tyk-dashboard.list

sudo apt-get update
```

**What we've done here is:**

*   Added the Tyk Dashboard repository
*   Updated our package list

### Step 2: Install the Tyk Dashboard

We're now ready to install the Tyk Dashboard. To install run:

```{.copyWrapper}
sudo apt-get install -y tyk-dashboard
```

What we've done here is instructed `apt-get` to install the Tyk Dashboard without prompting. Wait for the downloads to complete.

When the Tyk Dashboard has finished installing, it will have installed some `init` scripts, but it will not be running yet. The next step will be to setup each application - thankfully this can be done with three very simple commands.

## <a name="configure-tyk-dashboard"></a> Configure Tyk Dashboard

### Prerequisites

You need to ensure the MongoDB and Redis services are running before proceeding.

> **NOTE**: You need to replace `<hostname>` for `--redishost=<hostname>`, and `<IP Address>` for `--mongo=mongodb://<IP Address>/` with your own values to run this script.

We can set the dashboard up with a helper setup command script. This will get the dashboard set up for the local instance:
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo /opt/tyk-dashboard/install/setup.sh --listenport=3000 --redishost=<hostname> --redisport=6379 --mongo=mongodb://<IP Address>/tyk_analytics --tyk_api_hostname=$HOSTNAME --tyk_node_hostname=http://localhost --tyk_node_port=8080 --portal_root=/portal --domain="XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
```

> **Note**: Make sure to use the actual DNS hostname or the public IP of your instance as the last parameter.

What we have done here is:

*   `--listenport=3000`: Told the Tyk Dashboard (and Portal) to listen on port 3000.
*   `--redishost=<hostname>`: The Tyk Dashboard should use the local Redis instance.
*   `--redisport=6379`: The Tyk Dashboard should use the default port.
*   `--domain="XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"`: Bind the dashboard to the IP or DNS hostname of this instance (required).
*   `--mongo=mongodb://<IP Address>/tyk_analytics`: Use the local MongoDB (should always be the same as the gateway).
*   `--tyk_api_hostname=$HOSTNAME`: The Tyk Dashboard has no idea what hostname has been given to Tyk, so we need to tell it, in this instance we are just using the local HOSTNAME env variable, but you could set this to the public-hostname/IP of the instance.
*   `--tyk_node_hostname=http://localhost`: The Tyk Dashboard needs to see a Tyk node in order to create new tokens, so we need to tell it where we can find one, in this case, use the one installed locally.
*   `--tyk_node_port=8080`: Tell the dashboard that the Tyk node it should communicate with is on port 8080.
*   `--portal_root=/portal`: We want the portal to be shown on `/portal` of whichever domain we set for the portal.

### Step 1: Enter your Dashboard License

Add your license in `/opt/tyk-dashboard/tyk_analytics.conf` in the `license` field.

### Step 2: Start Tyk Dashboard

Start the dashboard service, and ensure it will start automatically on system boot.

```{.copyWrapper}
sudo service tyk-dashboard start
sudo service tyk-dashboard enable
```

### Step 3: Install Tyk Gateway

Follow gateway installation instructions to connect to this dashboard instance before you continue on to step 4.

### Step 4: Bootstrap the Dashboard with an initial User and Organisation

When the Tyk Dashboard is created for the first time, it has no initial user base or organisation to add data to, so we need to add this.

The best way to add this data is with the Admin API, to make it really easy we've supplied a bootstrap script that will set you up. If you want to customise it, take a look at the file in `/opt/tyk-dashboard/install/bootstrap.sh`.

**Prerequisites for this command**:

*   This command assumes you are running on a Linux shell such as Bash
*   This command assumes you have Python 2.7 or 3.4 installed

**To bootstrap your instance**:
```{.copyWrapper}
sudo /opt/tyk-dashboard/install/bootstrap.sh [DASHBOARD_HOSTNAME]
```

This command tells the bootstrap script to use the localhost as the base for the API calls, you can run the bootstrap remotely and change the first command line parameter to the DNS hostname of your instance.

You will now be able to log into and test your Tyk instance from `http://your-host-name:3000/` with the values given to you by the bootstrap script.
