Tyk has three containers that are available to set up a Docker installation:

* [The Tyk Gateway container][1]
* [The Tyk Dashboard container][2]
* [The Tyk Pump container][3]

All three are required for a full deployment. We recommend that each container is installed on a separate machine for optimum performance.
