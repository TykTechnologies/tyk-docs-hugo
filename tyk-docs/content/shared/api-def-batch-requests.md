### Batch Requests

* `enable_batch_request_support`: Set to true to enable batch support

* `dont_set_quota_on_create`: If set to true, when the API is used to edit, create or add keys, the quota cache in Redis will not be re-set.

* `expire_analytics_after`: Set this value to the number of seconds you would like your MongoDB data to last for.

* `response_processors`: Response processors need to be specifically defined so they are loaded on API creation, otherwise the middleware will not fire.

See [Batch Requests](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-rest-api/batch-requests/) for more details.
