## Bring your own Identity Provider - Dynamic Client Registration now available!

DCR is a protocol of the Internet Engineering Task Force put in place to set standards in the dynamic registration of clients with authorisation servers. This features is a way for you to integrate your developer portal with an external identity provider such as Keycloak, Gluu, Auth0 or Okta. 
The portal developer won't notice a difference. However when they create the app via Tyk Developer portal, Tyk will dynamically register that client on your authorization server. This means that it is the Authorization Server who will issue the Client ID and Client Secret for the app.

We also took this opportunity to give a refresh to the portal settings UI so let us know if you like it!
