<ul>
<li>MongoDB 4.4.x (with mgo driver)</li>
<li>MongoDB 4.4.x, 5.0.x, 6.0.x (with mongo-go driver)</li>
</ul>
<div class="note note-success">
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>mgo driver works with MongoDB 3.x to 4.2.x too, but we no longer test MongoDB versions prior to 4.4 since they are EOL</p>
</div>
<p>You can also use the following as a drop-in replacement for MongoDB:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/" target="_blank">Amazon DocumentDB</a> 3.6 and 4 engine</li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/introduction" target="_blank">Azure CosmosDB for MongoDB</a> 3.6 and 4 engine</li>
</ul>
